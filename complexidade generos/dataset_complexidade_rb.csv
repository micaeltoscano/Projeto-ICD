platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
i'ma keep on singing while i'm burning up that og
all my niggas get it, they make money all alone
rock a chain around they neck, making sure i'm getting home
when i travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
and i come back to my city, i fuck every girl i know
used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor

were so strong
that you can make it
through whatever
it's so hard
to accept the fact
you're gone forever

and we in the coldest one
which one did granny go to?
and why do death come?
as my baby ask
where do babies come from
i tell her where
i tell her why
and i tell her i love her
until i tell her bye
and whenever
i shall ever die
i hope you celebrate it
i hope you never hated
and they say heaven's gated

 querida caju
bom dia
 me escrevo essa carta em primeira pessoa
pelo exercício de me ver assim, livre
nessa estrada longa, a um destino que eu ainda não sei como será
mas que acredito veementemente
porque agora eu aprendi a andar depois de ficar de pé
escrevo isso e me lembro daquela cena do meu filme preferido, kill bill
quando beatrix kiddo fica horas depois do coma
tentando mexer os dedos, deitada na parte de trás do carro
hoje eu aprendi a correr
e é por isso que eu acordei e quis me colocar num ônibus com direção ao futuro
e eu pretendo passar o dia me observando, atenta
e peço, no fundo do pensamento
tomara que hoje faça um dia de sol
e, se houver neblina, que eu seja um sol interno
 de olhos abertos, eu observo o movimento na estrada
e penso na minha trajetória até aqui
nas inúmeras coisas que meus olhos já viram
e eu me percebo sendo uma grande colecionadora de boas memórias
é claro, dentro dessas memórias, também existem os equívocos
os deslizes, alguns tombos, precipícios
mas é impressionante que mesmo com esses declínios
eu ainda lembro como voar
 agora, com os fones de ouvidos bem ajustados
eu sei que eu quero um dia dançante depois de passar por esse estado
onde o corpo fica amuado, onde naturalmente eu fico de calundu
e me esquivo de qualquer coisa que me atravesse
pela escolha de viver o ranço, chega
eu realmente prometi ser o sol hoje
desde o momento que entrei nesse ônibus
eu vejo o trem passando na janela
e penso que às vezes é preciso alguém, um movimento espelhado ao seu
que lhe faça encontrar um outro sentido pros domingos
quando o relógio marca às treze
parece que o dia será um grande enguiço, um embrulho
um negócio efêmero
se eu pudesse, hoje eu faria um dia eterno
um mastro noturno, uma fogueira que não se abala pela água
um eclipse de estrelas
se eu pudesse, o dia de hoje seria disruptivo a tudo que é lógico
sorrio ao me imaginar assim, com meu possante na estrada
 é preciso ser o retrogosto da boca
e ser eterno em alguma memória

hold your own
when everything is fluid
nothing can be known with any certainty
hold your own
 hold it till you feel it there
as dark and dense and wet as earth
as vast and bright and sweet as air
when all there is is knowing
that you feel what you are feeling
hold your own
 ask your hands to know the things they hold
i know, the days are reeling past in such squealing blasts
but stop for breath and you will know it's yours
swaying like an open door when storms are coming
hold
 time is an onslaught, love is a mission
we work for vocations until, in remission
we wish we'd had patience and given more time to our children
feel each decision that you make
make it, hold it
 hold your own
hold your lovers
hold their hands
hold their breasts in your hands like your hands were their bra
hold their face in your palms like a prayer
hold them all night, feel them hold back
don't hold back
 hold your own
every pain
every grievance
every stab of shame
every day spent with a demon in your brain giving chase
hold it
 know the wolves that hunt you
in time, they will be the dogs that bring your slippers
love them right and you will feel them kiss you when they come to bite
hot snouts digging out your cuddles with their bloody muzzles
hold
 nothing you can buy will ever make you more whole
this whole thing thrives on us feeling always incomplete
and it is why we will search for happiness
in whatever thing it is we crave in the moment
and it is why we can never really find it there
 it is why you will sit there with the lover that you fought for
in the car you sweated years to buy
wearing the ring you dreamed of all your life
and some part of you will still be unsure that this is what you really want
stop craving
hold your own
 but if you're satisfied with where you're at, with who you are
you won't need to buy new make-up
or new outfits or new pots and pans
to cook new exciting recipes for new exciting people
to make yourself feel like the new exciting person
you think you're supposed to be
 happiness, the brand, is not happiness
we are smarter than they think we are
they take us all for idiots, but that's their problem
when we behave like idiots, it becomes our problem
so, hold your own
breathe deep on a freezing beach
taste the salt of friendship
notice the movement of a stranger
hold your own
and let it be

sem calma, sem nada, sem ar
 sem ponto, sem virgula, sem meia, descalça
descascou o medo pra caber coragem
sem calma, sem nada, sem ar (uh, uh)
 borrifou um segredo pra fazer a lua
temperou com calma teu desassossego
empanou com areia tua calma santa
salvou um beijo (ah-ah)
 chorou na despedida, mas gozaram chamas
amanheceu à guarda de esperar o sono
desesperou de medo quando ficou tarde
chamou minha atenção
 fazendo serenata
o mergulho foi tão bom que me encheu de graça
molhou meu coração, ebulindo fumaça

scraping for pearls on the roadside
there's a force stronger than nature
keeps her will alive
this is how she's dying
she's dying to survive
don't know what she's made of
i would like to be that brave
 she cries to the heaven above
there is a stone in my heart
she lives a life she didn't choose
and it hurts like brand-new shoes
 hurts like brand-new shoes
 there is a woman in somalia
the sun gives her no mercy
the same sky we lay under
burns her to the bone
long as afternoon shadows
it's gonna take her to get home
each grain carefully wrapped up
pearls for her little girl
 hallelujah
hallelujah
 she cries to the heaven above
there is a stone in my heart
she lives in a world she didn't choose
and it hurts like brand-new shoes
hurts like brand-new shoes",1.0,0.5496688741721855,0.6700000000000004,3.4906092,1.4623802417108482,151,1.2727272727272727,0.0703125,1
