it's supposed to be me asking
(why's the sky blue when i grow up i wanna be like you)
yo daddy can you teach me how to
(tie my shoes can i go with you to work so i can see what you do?)
lemme see what you do
so i can love my kids too
but you didn't stick around was that too much to ask of you?
too much to get a blueprint(no)
too much to show your way (no)
that's the reason why this building is not finished still today(we're lost boys)
so you wanna believe that (my daddy's coming back he didn't forget about me)
