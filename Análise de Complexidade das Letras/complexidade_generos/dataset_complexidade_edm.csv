when we see what we've become
in the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
not the fire that we begun
every argument, every word we can't take back
'cause with all that has happened
i think that we both know the way that the story ends
 then only for a minute
i want to change my mind

i wanna raise your spirits

and i'm left there with my thoughts
and the image of you being with someone else
well, it's eating me up inside
but we run our course, we pretend that we're okay
now if we jump together, at least we can swing
far away from the wreck we made

one thing i never see the same when your 'round
i don't believe in him, his lips on the ground
i wanna take you to that place in the roche
but no one gives us any time anymore
 he ask me once if i'd look in on his dog
you made an offer for it, then you ran off
i got this picture of us kids in my head
and all i hear is the last thing that you said
i listened to your problems, now listen to mine
i didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh
 and we will never be alone again

 it didn't matter what they wanted to see
he thought he saw someone that looked just like me
the summer memory that just never dies
we worked too long and hard to give it no time
he sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
cracks in the road that i would try and disguise
he runs his scissor at the seem in the wall
he cannot break it down or else he would fall
 one thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
take it, i don't wanna sing anymore
 i listened to your problems, now listen to mine
i didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh

 feel this moment
i see the future, but live for the moment, make sense, don't it?
now make dollars, i mean billions, i'm a genius, i mean brilliant
the streets are what schooled him
and made him slicker than slick, rick the ruler
i've lost a lot, and learned a lot
but i'm still undefeated, like shula
 i'm far from cheap, i break down companies with all my peeps
baby, we can travel the world
and i can give you and all you can see
time is money
only difference is i own it, like a stop watch
let's stop time and enjoy this moment, dale
 one day when the light is glowing
i'll be in my castle golden
but until the gates are open
i just wanna feel this moment
 whoa-oh-oh, i just wanna feel this moment
whoa-oh-oh, i just wanna feel this moment
 come on, feel this moment
