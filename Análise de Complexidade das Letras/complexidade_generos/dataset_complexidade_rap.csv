all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i can't get by with my nine-to-five
and i can't provide the right type of life for my family
'cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
and there's no movie, there's no mekhi phifer, this is my life
and these times are so hard and it's gettin' even harder
tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
caught up between being a father and a prima donna
baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
gotten me to the point i'm like a snail, i've got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

 i never had much, ran with a bad bunch
little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
and all through junior high, we was just gettin by
and drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
i never did cry, and even though i had
pain in my heart, i was hopeless from the start
they couldn't tell me nothin, they all tried to help to
the marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
i travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
i felt the pain and the rain but i'm still here
never did like the police, let the whole world know
now i gets no peace, cause they chasin me down
and facin me now, what do i do?
these thangs that a thug goes through
and still i rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
it's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
 
chorus:
 they say that things just cannot grow
beneath the winter snow,
or so i have been told.
 they say were buried far,
just like a distant star
i simply cannot hold
 
eminem:
 we're all we got in this world
when it spins, when it swirls
when it whirls, when it twirls
two little beautiful girls
lookin' puzzled, in a daze
i know it's confusing you
daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that, the more it backfires on me
all the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
but things have gotten so bad between us
i don't see us ever being together ever again
like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be
but it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
but no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

 they say that things just cannot grow

 dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
tell the homies i'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
seen a show with marvin gaye last night, it had me shook
drippin peppermint schnapps, with jackie wilson, and sam cooke
then some lady named billie holiday
sang sittin there kickin it with malcolm, 'til the day came
little latasha sho' grown
tell the lady in the liquorstore that she's forgiven, so come home
maybe in time you'll understand only god can save us
when miles davis cuttin lose with the band
just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
picture a place that they exist, together
there has to be a place better than this, in heaven
so right before i sleep, dear god, what i'm askin
remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

the future seemed so bright
then this thing turned out so evil
i don't know why i'm still surprised
 even angels have their wicked schemes
and you take that to new extremes
but you'll always be my hero
even though you've lost your mind
 just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
ooh, i love the way you lie
 now there's gravel in our voices
glass is shattered from the fight
in this tug of war, you'll always win
even when i'm right
 'cause you feed me fables from your hand
with violent words and empty threats
and it's sick that all these battles
are what keeps me satisfied
 just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
ooh, i love the way you lie
 so maybe i'm a masochist
i try to run, but i don't wanna ever leave
til the walls are goin' up
in smoke with all our memories
 this morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night
so i can push you off me
 try and touch me, so i can scream at you not to touch me
run out the room, and i'll follow you like a lost puppy
baby, without you, i'm nothing, i'm so lost, hug me
then tell me how ugly i am, but that you'll always love me
then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky
 together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
you hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?
i may have hit you three times, i'm startin' to lose count
but together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy, we're nuts, but i refused counsellin'
this house is too huge, if you move out, i'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
with you, i'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, i'm out it
 just gonna stand there and watch me burn

may i have your attention, please?
will the real slim shady please stand up?
i repeat, will the real slim shady please stand up?
we're gonna have a problem here
 y'all act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor, like pam like tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
they first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (agh!)
it's the return of the: ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
he didn't just say what i think he did, did he?
and dr. dre said: nothing, you idiots!
 dr. dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
feminist women love eminem
chicka, chicka, chicka, slim shady, i'm sick of him
look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though
yeah, i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose
but can't, but it's cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
my bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
and if i'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit fourth grade
they've got the discovery channel, don't they?
 we ain't nothin' but mammals
well, some of us, cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
but if you feel like i feel, i got the antidote
women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes
 i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
 'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
 will smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
well, i do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
you think i give a damn about a grammy?
half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
but slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?
why? so you guys could just lie to get me here?
so you can sit me here next to britney spears?
shit, christina aguilera better switch me chairs
so i can sit next to carson daly and fred durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch put me on blast on mtv
 yeah, he's cute, but i think he's married to kim, hee-hee
i should download her audio on mp3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem vd (agh!)
i'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
all you do is annoy me, so i have been sent here to destroy you
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
 'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
 'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
 i'm like a head trip to listen to
'cause i'm only givin' you things you joke about
with your friends inside your livin' room
the only difference is i got the balls to say it in front of y'all
and i don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
i just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it, i just shit it
better than 90% of you rappers out can
 then you wonder: how can kids eat up these albums like valiums?
it's funny, 'cause at the rate i'm going, when i'm 30
i'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurse's asses when i'm jacking off with jergens
and i'm jerking, but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
and every single person is a slim shady lurking
 he could be working at burger king, spittin' on your onion rings
or in the parking lot, circling, screaming: i don't give a fuck!
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up?
and put one of those fingers on each hand up?
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control?
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
 i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up
please stand up, please stand up?
 'cause i'm slim shady, yes, i'm the real shady
all you other slim shadys are just imitating
so won't the real slim shady please stand up

but i'm only going to get this one chance
something's wrong, i can feel it
(for six minutes, slim shady, you're on)
just a feeling i've got, like something's about to happen
but i don't know what
 if that means what i think it means
we're in trouble, big trouble
and if he is as bananas as you say
i'm not taking any chances
you were just what the doc ordered
 i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox
they said i rap like a robot, so call me rapbot
 but, for me, to rap like a computer must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my pen'll go off when i half-cock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a living and a killing off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
i'm an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
this flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
you don't really wanna get into a pissing match
with this rappity-rap
packing a mac in the back of the ac
backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
 and at the exact same time
i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while i'm practicing that
i'll still be able to break a mothafuckin' table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic
i was under aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow?
all i do is drop f-bombs
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are having a rough time, period
here's a maxipad
it's actually disastrously bad for the wack
while i'm masterfully constructing this master piece
 i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox
let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
 everybody want the key and the secret
to rap immortality like i have got
well, to be truthful the blueprint's
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
did nothing but shoot for the moon since
mc's get taken to school with this music
'cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
now i lead a new school full of students
 me? i'm a product of rakim, lakim shabazz, 2pac
n.w.a, cube, hey doc, ren, yella, eazy, thank you, they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up
blow up and be in a position to meet run dmc and induct them
into the mothafuckin' rock n' roll hall of fame
even though i'll walk in the church
and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i'll be inducted in
is the alcohol of fame, on the wall of shame
you fags think it's all a game
'til i walk a flock of flames off a plank
and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
 little gay-looking boy
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy
you're witnessing a mass-occur
like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy
you get a thumbs up, pat on the back
and a way to go from your label every day, looking boy
hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy
i get a hell, yeah from dre, looking boy
i'ma work for everything i have, never ask nobody for shit
get outta my face, looking boy
basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
to keep it up with the same pace, looking boy
 'cause i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
the way i'm racing around the track, call me nascar, nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park, the white trash god
kneel before general zod this planet's krypton, no asgard, asgard
 so you be thor and i'll be odin
you rodent, i'm omnipotent
let off then i'm reloading immediately
with these bombs i'm toting
and i should not be woken, i'm the walking dead
but i'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
but i got your mom deep throating
 i'm out my ramen noodle
we have nothing in common, poodle
i'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm
and pay homage, pupil
it's me, my honesty's brutal, but it's honestly futile
if i don't utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
 so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch
i scribble and doodle enough rhymes
to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case, 'cause even you unsigned rappers
are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
i know there was a time
where once i was king of the underground
but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
 appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come trying to censor you
like that one line i said on i'm back, from the mathers lp
one when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine
put 'em all in a line, add an ak-47, a revolver and a nine
 see, if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was
but i'm morphing into an immortal, coming through the portal
you're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're pointless as rapunzel with fucking cornrows
you write normal? fuck being normal
 and i just bought a new raygun from the future
just to come and shoot you
like when fabolous made ray j mad
'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad
singing to a man while they played piano
 man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station
the very next day: hey fab, i'ma kill you!
lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (j.j. fad)
 uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming i'm a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you? i'm superhuman
innovative and i'm made of rubber
so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me
and it'll glue to you
 and i'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
how to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
never fading, and i know the haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off, they'll be celebrating
'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated
i make elevating music, you make elevator music
 oh, he's too mainstream
well, that's what they do when they get jealous
they confuse it
it's not hip-hop, it's pop
'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock
shock rap with doc
 throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it
i don't know how to make songs like that
i don't know what words to use
let me know when it occurs to you
while i'm ripping any one of these verses
that versus you, it's curtains
i'm inadvertently hurting you
how many verses i gotta murder to
 prove that if you were half as nice your songs
you could sacrifice virgins too
school flunky, pill junky
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself, but still hungry
i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to
and i'm a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues
 but it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
i'm drunk, so satan take the fucking wheel
i'm asleep in the front seat
bumping heavy d and the boyz
still chunky, but funky
but in my head there's something
i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils
and here's what they want from me
 they're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i had
then you may be a little patient
and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
 but fuck it, life's handing you lemons
make lemonade then, but if i can't batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then?
don't mistake him for satan, it's a fatal mistake
if you think i need to be overseas
and take a vacation to trip abroad
and make her fall on her face
and don't be a retard
be a king? think not
why be a king when you can be a god?",10.0,0.4284781188765513,7.779999999999879,2.7824898,1.483766120540937,1531,1.0217391304347827,-0.04937753546244112,1

i have no snare in my headphones
there you go
 have you ever been hated or discriminated against? i have
i've been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
 all this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans exploding
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep going
not taking nothing from no one, give'em hell long as i'm breathing
keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
 leave 'em with a taste of sour as vinegar in their mouth
see, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
look at me now, i bet you're probably sick of me now
ain't you, mama? i'ma make you look so ridiculous now
 i'm sorry, mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but, tonight, i'm cleanin' out my closet
 (one more time)
i said: i'm sorry, mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but, tonight, i'm cleanin' out my closet
 i got some skeletons in my closet and i don't know if no one knows it
so, before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73
before i ever had a multi-platinum selling cd
 i was a baby, maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
cos' he split, i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no, i don't, on second thought, i just fucking wished he would die
 i look at hailie and i couldn't picture leaving her side
even if i hated kim, i'd grit my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her, at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human, but i'm man enough to face 'em today
 what i did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets out of that gun
cos' i'da killed them, shit, i would've shot kim and them both
this my life, i'd like to welcome ya'll to the eminem show
 i'm sorry, mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but, tonight, i'm cleanin' out my closet
 (one more time)
i said: i'm sorry, mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but, tonight, i'm cleanin' out my closet
 now i would never dis my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen who you think this record is dissin'
but put yourself in my position, just try to envision
witnessin' yo mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
 bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
goin' through public housing system, victim of münchhausen's syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasn't
til i grew up, now i blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach
doesn't it?
 wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me, ma?
so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
well, guess what, you're getting older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
and nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna know that your phony
 and hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
but you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
see, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
bitch, do ya song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom
 but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?
you selfish bitch, i hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
well, guess what? i am dead, dead to you as can be
 i'm sorry, mama
i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry

i'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse (give out from underneath me)
 music is like magic
there's a certain feelin' you get when you real and you spit
and people are feelin' your shit, this is your moment
and every single minute you spend tryna hold on to it
'cause you may never get it again
so while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'cause i'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
i got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
it goes: reggie, jay-z, 2pac and biggie
andré from outkast, jada, kurupt, nas, and then me
but in this industry i'm the cause of a lot of envy
so when i'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
that's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
you hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
the press's wet dream, like bobby and whitney, nate, hit me!
 till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps
i'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse
 till the roof comes off, till the lights go out (until the roof, until the roof)
till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (the roof comes off, the roof comes off)
till the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps (until my legs, until my legs)
i'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse (give out from underneath me)
 soon as a verse starts, i eat at an mc's heart
what is he thinkin'? how not to go against me, smart
and it's absurd how people hang on every word
i'll probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but i'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth, that would be the death of me first
'cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin' could ever be worse
that's why i'm clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic, i act like i'm an addict
i rap like i'm addicted to smack like i'm kim mathers
but i don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a full-blown attack i'm launchin' at 'em
the track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'cause i don't really think that the fact that i'm slim matters
a plaque and platinum status is wack if i'm not the baddest, so
 till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
till the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps
i'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse
 till the roof comes off, till the lights go out (until the roof, until the roof)
till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (the roof comes off, the roof comes off)
till the smoke clears out, am i high? perhaps (until my legs, until my legs)
i'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse (give out from underneath me)
 until the roof (until the roof)
the roof comes off (the roof comes off)
until my legs (until my legs)
give out from underneath me
 i, i will not fall, i will stand tall
feels like no one can beat me",2.0,0.33962264150943394,4.679999999999945,2.5990639,0.9895402548686634,954,1.2253521126760563,-0.04568627450980391,1

getting in relationships like this (i'm just sayin')
maybe it says something about me
should i look in the mirror?
 i just want you to be normal
why can't you bitches be normal?
always gotta be so extra
why you always need a lecture?
my ex hates to talk, she's a texter
even when i'm in bed layin' right next to her
wants to get back together
said not till she gets her act together
 she thinks i'm bein' mean
and now she starts to scream and shout
she's about to let the demons out
she don't want to see me with other females out
i tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
she retaliates by tryin' to leave the house in her evening gown with her cleavage out
we've been down this road too many times for me to count
and all i can think about is how
 i just want you to be normal
why can't you bitches be normal?
always gotta be so extra
like a fuckin' terrestrial
guess it comes with the territory
my ex girl, she just declared war
therefore, i better prepare for it
i guess bein' weird's normal
 and i don't know what's got a hold of me
most notably i've been zone [?]
i'm totally open, hoplessly devoted
so much so that i bet you she don't know
that she's the first thing i think of when i wake up
and the last thing i think of before i go to sleep
sike
hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
i know she cheats [?]
 she's heartless
no wonder we're partners
both got hundreds of charges
domestic disputes but we've always
swept it under the carpet
even when 911 gets the call that
i slipped up and busted her jaw with
a louisville slugger 'cause alls it
really does is make our love
for each other grow stronger
 she won me over the second she tried to run me over
told her i'd keep a hun
we all but kicked her out, called her back now she's coming over
but why is she so wicked?
and how the fuck did i get so twisted
i wish i won someone like a [?]
we're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
ignitable liquids
but i'm finally seeing
she's only mine for the time being
that's why i keep bringing up that one time she
tried to two time me
and throw it up in her face till i dry heave
how could i be so naive?
should i leave or turn this entire evening
into a fucking crime scene
 maybe i'm just too ugly to compete with him
you weren't supposed to agree you fucking bitch
especially when you're the one cheated first
now the argument immediately becomes heated
you don't want me flip little conceded cunt
eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita
fajita slut treat just like a drum
beat it, complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
 i love you but i hope you fucking die though
in our business your friends like to pry so
you've got 'em all under cover just like a most
hoppin' they'll come back with intel
but i'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'cause now the roles are reversed so here i go
thinkin' i'm sly as i scroll through you're iphone
who the fuck's milo?
the guy at work who drives a hi-lo
i put a tracking device on your crystler
and follow you while you drive home
but like a cyclone, i just got my disguise blown
you recognize me and had milo flip me off right out the passenger side window
i hit a light pole, you skirt off and then pull up at 5am in the drive in a stretch white limo
stumble in the side door and hit me head with milo's demo
but like a drunk bum what do i know?
let's sleep on it like they did revival
i told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole
 just wanna be normal
why can't you be normal?
yeah, i just wanna be normal
why can't you be normal?",5.0,0.4811715481171548,3.9499999999999598,2.2502704,1.4916595699111994,717,1.0449438202247192,0.014570105820105823,1

first verse, uh
i'm on 'til i'm on a island
my life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
before i touch dirt, i'll kill you all wit' kindness
i kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
you've been warned if you've been born or if you can form
slap up a cop and then snatch 'i'm out of his uniform
leave him wit' his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
and hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
bet you could light your own cigarette witcha asshole
me and shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow
i might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
though i ain't wrapped tight
my blood type's the '80s!
my '90s was like the navy, you was like the bradys
you still fly kites daily!

let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
and i hope that i don't sound too heinous when i say this

and that's back wit' a capital b wit' an exclamation mark, maybe
you should listen when i flip the linguistics
'cause i'm'onna rip this mystical slick shit
you don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit

i'ma kick the ballistics! so get this dick, i'ma live this

livin' life in the fast lane
movin' at the speed of life and i can't slow down
only got a gallon in the gas tank

my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
at war wit' a bottle, this captain morgan attacks my organs
my slow flow is euphoric, it's like i rap endorphins
i made a pact with the devil that says ""i'll let you take me
you let me take this shovel, dig up the corpes, jack kevorkian""
go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
i'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
my tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers
spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity
 [eminem]
now, was called eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
chewed him up (pt! ) and spitted him out
girl, giddy-up, now get, get down
he's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now
here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
did i s-st-stutter, motherf-cker f-ck them all, he's just
a whole motherfuckin' walmart d-d-down every time a-r-r-round
and he came to the club tonight wit' 5'9'' to hold this bitch down
like a motherf-ckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown
shawty, when you dance, you got me captivated
just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips, i'm agitated, aggravated
to the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then i'm have to take it
 [royce]
and then after takin' that, i'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
it's gon' say ""the whole rap game passed away"" on top of the affadavit
graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
to michael jackson' activator (woo! )
meanin' i'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data
runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater
don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
drop in the lap of a tax evader (homie, they spent)
 [eminem]
now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
what, girl, i'm the crack-a-lator
brung ya lay to this party, be my penis ejaculator later
tell you boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
you rollin' wit' a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin'
 [hook]
livin' life in the fast lane
movin' at the speed of life and i can't slow down
only got a gallon in the gas tank
but i'm almost at the finish line, so i can't stop now
 i don't really know where i'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
just gon' roll 'til i drop and ride 'til i die
i'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

thou shall now watch two lesbians in bed 
have homosexual sex

either before, during, or after performing the act of that which 
is normally reffered to as such more commonly known phrases

alone in his own zone, cold, and he don't care
he's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (bitch)
'cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
his thoughts are wacked, he's mad, so he's talkin' back
talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
he sags his pants, durags and a stockin' cap

journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
that's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
so i'm signin' cds while police fingerprint me
they're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
if i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, b
it's all political, if my music is literal

sing with me (sing), sing for the year (sing it)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (sing that shit)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away
 they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
see, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
and they wanna get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
we entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
you ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
we just explain it
and then we get our checks in the mail
it's fucked up, ain't it?
how we can come from practically nothin'
to bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
that's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (haha)
who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
so they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
we're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
that's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
just let our spirits live on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, so we can
 sing with me (sing), sing for the year (sing it)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on)
sing it with me, it's just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away
 sing with me (sing), sing for the year (sing it)
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (come on)

the future seemed so bright
then this thing turned out so evil
i don't know why i'm still surprised
 even angels have their wicked schemes
and you take that to new extremes
but you'll always be my hero
even though you've lost your mind
 just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
ooh, i love the way you lie
 now there's gravel in our voices
glass is shattered from the fight
in this tug of war, you'll always win
even when i'm right
 'cause you feed me fables from your hand
with violent words and empty threats
and it's sick that all these battles
are what keeps me satisfied
 just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's all right because i like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's all right because i love the way you lie
i love the way you lie
ooh, i love the way you lie
 so maybe i'm a masochist
i try to run, but i don't wanna ever leave
til the walls are goin' up
in smoke with all our memories
 this morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night
so i can push you off me
 try and touch me, so i can scream at you not to touch me
run out the room, and i'll follow you like a lost puppy
baby, without you, i'm nothing, i'm so lost, hug me
then tell me how ugly i am, but that you'll always love me
then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky
 together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
you hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?
i may have hit you three times, i'm startin' to lose count
but together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy, we're nuts, but i refused counsellin'
this house is too huge, if you move out, i'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
with you, i'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, i'm out it
 just gonna stand there and watch me burn

then came the cash then the baby momma drama,
i gave the b-tch a half a mill,
she blew it on prada,
i remember when i met da b-tch and she aint had nada,
now got my son on some fly sh-t,
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
now i got to buy sh-t,
man i can't even flunk sh-t cos everybody want sh-t,
everybody mad, damn even my dad,
and i don't even know him now how the f-ck i owe him,
i aint giving nobody sh-t imma show them,
i gave game hits, he told me to suck d-ck,
start screaming wesstside and dre aint say sh-t,
now we just eat of 'em and when i talk to em
a smile comes on his face,
he told me whats the case,
enemies stay enemies,
but friends they change,
n-ggas go crazy over money my mayne,

now fifty-two bars come it, now you feel 'em
now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling
in case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin
with a boss bitch of course s.c. on the sleeve
at the 40/40 club, espn on the screen

no chrome on the wheels, i'm a grown-up for real

it's not a dis song
it's just a real song
feel me?
 i heard motherfuckers saying they made hov
made hov say, ""ok so, make another hov""
niggaz wasn't playing they day role
so we parted ways like ben and j-lo
i shoulda been did it but i been in a daze though
i put friends over business end of the day though
but when friends, business interests as they go
ain't nothing left to say though
i guess we forgot what we came fo'
shoulda stayed in food and beverage
too much flossing
too much sam rothstein
i ain't a bitch but i gotta divorce them
hov have to get the shallow shit up off him
and i ain't even want to be famous
niggaz is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
and i ain't even know how it came to this
except that fame is
the worst drug known to man
it's stronger than, heroin
when you could look in the mirror like, ""there i am""
and still not see, what you've become
i know i'm guilty of it too but, not like them
you lost one
 lose one, let go to get one
left one, lose some to win some (you lost one)
story of a champion, sorry i'm a champion
you lost one
 i don't think it's meant to be, be
but she loves her work more than she does me
and honestly, at twenty-three
i would probably love my work more than i did she
so b, ain't we
it's me, and her
'cause what she prefers over me, is work
and that's, where we, differ
so i have to give her
free, time, even if it hurts
so breathe, mami, it's deserved
you've been put on this earth to be
all you can be, like the reserves
and me? my time in the army, it's served
so i have to allow she, her, time to serve
the time's now for her
in time she'll mature
and maybe we, can be, we, again like we were
finally, my time's too short to share
and to ask her now, it ain't fair
so yeah, she lost one
 lose one, let go to get one
left one, lose some to win some (oh yeah, she lost one)
story of a champion, sorry i'm a champion
you lost one
 my nephew died in the car i bought
so i'm under the belief it's partly my fault
close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
place any burden on me, but please, not that lord
time don't go back, it go forward
can't run from the pain, go towards it
some things can't be explained, what caused it?
such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit
gonna see you again, i'm sure of it
'til that time, little man i'm nauseous
your girlfriend's pregnant, the lord's gift
almost lost my faith, that restored it
it's like having your life restarted
can't wait for your child's life, to be a part of it
so now i'm child-like, waiting for a gift
to return, when i lost you, i lost it
 lose one, let go to get one
left one, lose some to win some (colleek, i lost one)

and it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
i, i just cry for no reason
i just pray for no reason
i just thank for the life, for the day
for the hours and another life breathin'
i did it all 'cause it feel good
you could live it all if you feel bad
better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

me and the homies
(i ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
me and the homies
(matter fact, i hop out that mothafucka and be like
""doo! doo! doo! doo!... doo! doo! doo! doo! doo!"" )
 it's 2: 30 and the sun is beaming
air conditioner broke and i hear my stomach screaming
hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
i'll tell you to suck my dick then i'll continue eating
we speeding on the 405 passing westchester
you know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good lord
they knew we weren't from 'round there
'cause every time we down there we pulling out the boost mobile sim cards
bougie bitches with no extensions
hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
before we sparked a conversation
we seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating
i never was a gang banger, i mean i was never stranger to the funk neither
i really doubt it
rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
that's ironic 'cause i've never been violent, until i'm with the homies
 (just ridin', just ridin')
me and the homies
(bullshittin', actin' a fool)
me and the homies
(trippin', really trippin')
me and the homies
(just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'…)
 bragging 'bout the episode we just had
a shot of hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
i'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
we tryna conquer the city with disobedience
quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the cd in
but jeezy still playing and our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you saying""
pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
the sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(ay, ay, nigga cash out nigga, pop the safe
ay nigga, i think it's somebody in this room
wait, what?
nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
i hit the back window in search of any nintendo
dvds, plasma screen tvs in the trunk
we made a right, then made a left, then made a right
then made a left, we was just circling life
my mama called – ""hello? what you doin'?"" kicking it ""
i should've told her i'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense with the homies
 but they made a right, they made a left then made a right

I went from having somebody<br/>Manage me to me hiring the person that works<br/>My management company. I changed everything I realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I’m saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying. I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us<br/>And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?</p><p>By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true. You know what I’m saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I’m saying, I was noticing, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it’s no problem, you know I mean it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know. I’m finna go straight through<br/>Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?</p><p>I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been threatened with resistance it’s been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back<br/>Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win and I wanna lay it all down</p><p>In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause once you turn 30 it’s like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. And you don’t wanna fight no more. And if you don’t believe me you can look around, you don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas<br/>That’s crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I can truly tell you that there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?</p><p>Shit, I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it’s a riot there’s gonna be bloodshed for real. I don’t think america can know that. I think american think we was just playing and it’s gonna be some more playing but it ain’t gonna be no playing. It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like nat turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen</p><p>That’s crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don’t understand how important it is. Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don’t know what type of energy I’mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes<br/>Because the spirits, we ain’t really rappin’,<br/>We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us<br/>Damn<br/>I wanted to read one last thing to you<br/>It’s actually something a good friend<br/>Had wrote describing my world. It says<br/>“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it<br/>Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it<br/>In order to protect itself from this mad city<br/>While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive<br/>One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly<br/>The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar<br/>But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar<br/>Sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits<br/>Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar<br/>Goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him<br/>He can no longer see past his own thoughts<br/>He’s trapped<br/>When trapped inside these walls certain ideas<br/>Start to take roots, such as going home<br/>And bringing back new concepts to this mad city</p><p>The result?<br/>Wings begin to emerge, breaking<br/>The cycle of feeling stagnant<br/>Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations<br/>That the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle<br/>Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely<br/>Different, they are one and the same.""<br/>What’s your perspective on that?<br/>Pac, pac, pac</p> ",RAP,"the ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it

 ""i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power, full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in the hotel room
i didn’t wanna self destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
 but that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
or maybe how a-1 my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting
the continuous war back in the city, i was entering a new one
a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
made me wanna go back to the city
and tell the homies what i learned
the word was respect
 just because you wore a different gang colour than mines
doesn’t mean i can’t respect you as a black man
forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
if i respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
but i don’t know, i’m no mortal man, maybe i’m just another nigga”
shit and that’s all i wrote
i was gonna call another nigga but, it ain’t really a poem
i just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
 other than that, now that i finally got a chance to holla at you
i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa
about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground
what you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent?
the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
that’s how i see it, my word is bon
i see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
the poor people is gonna open up this whole world
and swallow up the rich people
 cause the rich people gonna be so fat
they gonna be so appetising, you know what i’m saying
wealthy, appetising. the poor gonna be so poor and hungry
you know what i’m saying it’s gonna be like
there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich
 aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself
as somebody that’s rich or somebody that made
the best of their own opportunities?
i see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler
in every sense of the word. i took nothin’, i took the opportunities
i worked at the most menial and degrading job
and built myself up so i could get it to where
 i owned it. i went from having somebody
manage me to me hiring the person that works
my management company. i changed everything i realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what i’m saying i made myself a millionaire. i made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what i’m saying. i made millions for the record companies, i made millions for these movie companies, now i make millions for us
and through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
 by my faith in god, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true. you know what i’m saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what i’m saying, i was noticing, i was punching the right buttons and it was happening. so it’s no problem, you know i mean it’s a problem but i’m not finna let them know. i’m finna go straight through
would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
 i like to think that at every opportunity i’ve ever been threatened with resistance it’s been met with resistance. and not only me but it goes down my family tree. you know what i’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back
aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, i’m fighting a war i can’t win and i wanna lay it all down
 in this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. cause once you turn 30 it’s like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man in this country. and you don’t wanna fight no more. and if you don’t believe me you can look around, you don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas
that’s crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?
 shit, i think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it’s a riot there’s gonna be bloodshed for real. i don’t think america can know that. i think american think we was just playing and it’s gonna be some more playing but it ain’t gonna be no playing. it’s gonna be murder, you know what i’m saying, it’s gonna be like nat turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. you know what i’m saying, it’s gonna happen
 that’s crazy man. in my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don’t understand how important it is. sometimes i be like, get behind a mic and i don’t know what type of energy i’mma push out, or where it comes from. trip me out sometimes
because the spirits, we ain’t really rappin’,
we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
damn
i wanted to read one last thing to you
it’s actually something a good friend
had wrote describing my world. it says
“the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
in order to protect itself from this mad city
while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
the butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar
sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar
goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
he can no longer see past his own thoughts
he’s trapped
when trapped inside these walls certain ideas
start to take roots, such as going home
and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
 the result?
wings begin to emerge, breaking
the cycle of feeling stagnant
finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle
although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely
different, they are one and the same.""
what’s your perspective on that?

on the day niko had that seizure, i lost one of my biggest believers, ohh
close deaths make you think about your life
like if i had the same chance twice, what would i do different?
i'd tell her i loved her more, do more
but tease her bout crying on that picture
now when i'm done recording, swear i let the beat bang in her name
make her shake her head in heaven saying they at it again
make them clouds turn to speakers
don't take too much smoke from the reefer
love being in the room with her peoples
now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
lord, what kind of life is this?
mama, i just wanna sing
mama said, according to get everything
you gotta risk everything

now
 when i was 27, i grew accustomed to more fear
accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
my newfound life made all of me magnified
how many accolades do i need to block denial?
the shock value of my success put bolts in me
all this money, is god playin' a joke on me?
is it for the moment, and will he see me as job?
take it from me and leave me worse than i was before?
at 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
scared to go back to section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and i still won't buy me no lexus
 what is an advisor? somebody that's holdin' my checks
just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
i read a case about rihanna's accountant and wondered
how did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
the type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil somethin'
i practiced runnin' from fear, guess i had some good luck
at 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
how they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
what they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
what they see from me would trickle down generations in time
what they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
 i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
i'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'cause my dna won't let me involve in the light of god
 i'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
i'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
i'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
 fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me, so, hopefully, they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
 fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me, so, hopefully, they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
wonderin' if i'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
damn
 god damn you
god damn me
god damn us
god damn we
 god damn us all
 verse 2 says
you only have i known of all the families of the earth
therefore, i will punish you for all your iniquities
so until we come back to these commandments
until you come back to these commandments
we gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
because he said he's gonna punish us
the so-called blacks, hispanics and native american indians
are the true children of israel
we are the israelites, according to the bible
the children of israel
he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
because we chose to follow other gods
that man chastens his son, so the lord, thy god, chasten thee
so, just like you chasten your own son, he's gonna chasten you
because he loves you, so that's why we get chastised
that's why we're in the position that we're in
until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments
and do what the lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
we gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
here, in today, in the united states of america
 i love you, family, and i pray for you
god bless you

i want everything black, i ain't need black
some white, some black, i ain't mean black
i want everything black
 six in the mornin', fire in the street
burn, baby, burn, that's all i wanna see
and sometimes i get off watchin' you die in vain
it's such a shame they may call me crazy
they may say i suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
but homie, you made me
black don't crack, my nigga
 i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this, witnesses will convey just what i mean
been feeling this way since i was 16, came to my senses
you never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, i meant it
i'm african-american, i'm african
i'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
pardon my residence
came from the bottom of mankind
my hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
you hate me don't you?
you hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
you're fuckin' evil i want you to recognize that i'm a proud monkey
you vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
and this is more than confession
i mean i might press the button just so you know my discretion
i'm guardin' my feelins, i know that you feel it
you sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
 the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry, the bigger i shoot
 i said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
and man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
how you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
but now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
all them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that
 i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this, witnesses will convey just what i mean
i mean, it's evident that i'm irrelevant to society
that's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
curse me till i'm dead
church me with your fake prophesizing that i'mma be just another slave in my head
institutionalize manipulation and lies
reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
you hate me don't you?
i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
jealous of my wisdom and cards i dealt
watchin' me as i pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
black and successful, this black man meant to be special
cat scans on my radar bitch, how can i help you?
how can i tell you i'm making a killin'?
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
 i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
when i finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
this plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
it's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
i'm african-american, i'm african
i'm black as the heart of a fuckin' aryan
i'm black as the name of tyrone and darius
excuse my french but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
that's as blunt as it gets, i know you hate me, don't you?
you hate my people, i can tell cause it's threats when i see you
i can tell cause your ways deceitful
know i can tell because you're in love with that desert eagle
thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
it's funny how zulu and xhosa might go to war
two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
remind me of these compton crip gangs that live next door
beefin' with pirus, only death settle the score
so don't matter how much i say i like to preach with the panthers
or tell georgia state ""marcus garvey got all the answers""
or try to celebrate february like it's my b-day
or eat watermelon, chicken, and kool-aid on weekdays
or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements
or watch bet cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street?
when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?

 i hear brenda's got a baby
well, brenda's barely got a brain
a damn shame
tha girl can hardly spell her name
(that's not her problem, that's up ta brenda's family)
well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
now brenda never really knew her moms and her dad was a
junky
went in debt to his arms, it's sad
cause i bet brenda doesn't even know
just cause your in tha ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
but oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch tha joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when tha check came they got first dibs
now brendas belly is gettin bigger
but no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
she's 12 years old and she's having a baby
in love with tha molester, whos sexed and crazy
and yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
and dreams of a world with tha two of them are together
whatever
he left her and she had tha baby solo, she had it on tha
bathroom floor
and didn't know so, she didn't know, what ta throw away and
what ta keep
she wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heep
i guess she thought she'd get away
wouldn't hear tha cries
she didn't realize
how much tha tha little baby had her eyes
now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
momma can't help her, but it hurts ta hear her calling
brenda wants ta run away
momma say, you makin' me lose pay, tha social workers here
everyday
now brenda's gotta make her own way
can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
no money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
she tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbed
so now what's next, there ain't nothin left ta sell
so she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
it's payin tha rent, so she really can't complain
prostitute, found slain, and brenda's her name, she's got a

there's rules to this shit, i wrote me a manual
a step-by-step booklet for you to get
your game on track, not your wig pushed back
 rule nombre uno: never let no one know
how much dough you hold 'cause you know
the cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
if that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
 number two: never let 'em know your next move
don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence?
take it from your highness (uh-huh)
i done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
 number three: never trust nobody
your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
she be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
 number four: i know you heard this before
never get high on your own supply

i don't care if they want an ounce, tell 'em: bounce!
 number six: that goddamn credit? dead it
you think a crackhead paying you back? shit, forget it
 seven: this rule is so underrated
keep your family and business completely separated
money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
find yourself in serious shit
 number eight: never keep no weight on you
them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
 number nine shoulda been number one to me
if you ain't gettin' bagged, stay the fuck from police
if niggas think you snitchin', they ain't tryna listen
they be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
 number ten: a strong word called consignment
strictly for live men, not for freshmen
if you ain't got the clientele, say: hell no!
'cause they gon' want they money rain, sleet, hail, snow

 can i live til my last day
hittin honies that be na-sty
gettin money in the fast way
and i only care halfway
but i still can't let you pass me
 [the lox]
yo what's beef to you, three niggaz with hoodies and bats
that ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
when we came here we cut off all kind circulation
breathin, eatin, the whole situation
when we do our shit we do our shit for real
while you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
i'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
rock top shit you know how the lox get
then you can see me flyin in the bentley cockpit
lox and b-i, hold our grica down for years
gang not, but we been had our black tears
niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got
underground, all above must get shot
you couldn't book me dano, see luciano put the burners
to all y'all, what nigga bring it i'm callin y'all
 you already know what it's about when i run up in your house
put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
i give this fagg*t a french kiss
black gloves, no prints, dark tints
word on the street they ain't heard from him since
you know about life after kicked the kid in
since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
scri-dam the flow is forbidd-en
either you ridin or you dyin cause we swingin iron
lox and poppa, turning niggaz into jim hoffa
who gon stop us, it's your last joint double copper
you gettin money or your runnin from the feds
ain't nothin over here but sixteen and one in the head
and i solemnly swear
that all y'all niggaz out there got a problem this year
 [chorus: repeat 2x]
 [the lox]
before you think of keepin me down, heatin me down
the flow like water get deepe and you drown
with no soul, many niggaz roll with no dough
even the small dunn got a little black hole
your destiny is somethin you can never figure out
niggaz is never happy til there's blood up in your mouth
there's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to play in
this?
a lot are dead, how the hell you take the pain?
live with it got money you better get with it
my man had the thug in him did his bid with it
get married to the game but never have a kid with it
advice from the wise, slice the pies
too many schemes divides, when dreams collide
teams provide, war for the street to absorb
stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
only a blind dove'll fall in love with a whore
 [notorious b.i.g.]
uhh, uhh, uhh
who the f**k wanna squeeze?
my desert ease make mc's freeze
you wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams
you still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
you just pop wines i must pop nines
genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
you're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
we can hook up, all i see is the future
disrespect, i shoot ya
by the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
i be the mob fiance, about to marry it
illegal transactions in farragut with arabics
why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
my first lp, beef with me is unhealthy
f**k around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
collapsed lung, look how many gats i brung
for them homos, still doin promos
break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shined to glow
mo'
nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need for mo'

like a crusier within a range with  the rover
instead of you feeling strange to a soldier

i already found the key so lets crawl on the floor
but i decided to rob but we still tracked
i have found a shop i gotta bust that hoe who you gotta drive

 verse three: puff daddy
 nothing but clouds and white suits fill my vision
watching my life go down, like christian
listen hear them bullets rang, shotguns and mac millis
spraying like a hurricane in this war called the terror game
and deuce deuces can't stand the pain
little guns ain't got no business in this blizzard
they just kibitz, here's five shots to visit, blaka
blowin bullet holes sizes of door knockers
three headed for my chest straight, the other two
came a little late, and just barely missed my face
i'm tryin to find a steady place between two cars
one of us gon' either wind up dead, or behind bars
shit, i'm just tryin to live, so i can raise my kid
and own the world, bone all the girlie girls
that's when i finally figured out
that's that nigga david arthur, sharese baby father
and i didn't even bother to ask no further questions
no more confessions only suggestions
i think sam set me up, cause them bullets squeezed up
from the rear, and sam was the only nigga there
then they all peeled out in the rental, aluminum
sam in the passenger seat, so i'm assumin them
niggaz didn't even get to peep
lil' kim and them, in the backseat, with the heat
clips they feelin em, to the top, shit ain't sweet
once the light turns red, nuff said, that's dead
they fled, and they waved, hot lead
if i aimed up, i'd be on my deathbed
sucker move, for that they don't get no props
lil' kim and them, mad they ain't bust no shots
we in the block, no land posters just old posters
of gangsta niggaz i see ghosts of gangsta figures
i'm tryin to hold my own when they snatched me out the car
took me in the saloon and said, ""puffy, there you are""
them same cats we chased two blocks had new spots
washin dishes, i guess for goin out like bitches
i smacked em, gave a little speech, to mirth
happiness, cause me and all my peeps got hurt
that night, i said a little prayer, me and justin

 is a house really a home when your loved ones are gone
and n-ggas got the nerve to blame you for it
and you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
but oyu felt it and still feel it
and money can't make up for it or conceal it
but you deal with it and you keep ballin'
pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
but we've been living as friends
so you've been a guest in your own home
it's time to make your house your home
pick up your phone, come on

aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
when you get hurt by the one you living for,
pain can make you wanna love no more,
 loving you no more,
i just i cant i just can't be loving you no more,
i love you more than i love myself,
loving you no more,
i just i cant i just can't be loving you no more,
i love you more than i love myself
 hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly,
so many lonely sleepless nights,
im going through hell to convince you love me,
but never her approval no matter how i try,
the way you talk to me but still i say i love you,
i'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
momma always told me to respect the woman,
but what am i to do when her parents do not try,
 so many tears i cried,
but all for nothing i'm afraid to say,
oooooohhh
 loving you no more,
i just i cant i just can't be loving you no more,
i love you more than i love myself,
loving you no more,
i just i cant i just can't be loving you no more,
i love you more than i love myself
 i've been so dependent on your love for so long,
punishment for me is trying to let go,
give it from your heart is what you taught me,
addiction to pain is what it got me,
my life, now its changed,
my life aint the same as you are,
heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it,
if i can't have what mean most to me,
 so many tears i cried,
but all for nothing i'm afraid to say,
 loving you no more,
i just i cant i just can't be loving you no more,
i love you more than i love myself,
loving you no more,
i just i cant i just can't be loving you no more,
i love you more than i love myself
 uh, trying not to over think
only cause i've drove and i done had a lot to drink
when i wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
and there's pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
and you still got underwear that's sittin in the dryer
how come every time that you're suspicious i'm a liar?
you stand out, i can hear you whistle in a choir
and that's the only reason you the mrs. i admire
damn. tell me what i'm gone do
since everything i'm trying to forget is all true
me and all your main girls get along too
i would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
but ahhhhh, you see the same one i'm missing
is basically the reason i became something different
and just that i remember me before
and if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure
 loving you no more,

know that i'ma ride for ya, either way it go
tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
when you tell me you love me, can't you see i'm tryna climb?
damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
if you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
come here baby why you always insecure?
hold on tight to a nigga and be sure
 ain't a way around it no more, i am the greatest
a lotta niggas sat on the throne, i am the latest
i am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
i ain't afraid of you niggas, i'll end up fading you niggas
'fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
my uzi, it weighed a ton, i need me a better gun
in fact i just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
and i got something to prove
forgive me lord here they come, blaoow
 my inhibition's fighting my intuition
premature premonition
showing me the demolition of these phony niggas
so ahead of my time
even when i rhyme about the future i be reminiscing
you want the truth well come and listen
i'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked
ya phone and saw it was a number missing
as fate passes you by, half of you try
the other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
 one day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
a scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
keep it true like me, cole you might be
like the new ice cube, meets the new ice-t
meets 2 live crew, meets the new spike lee
meets bruce like wayne, meets bruce like lee
meets '02 lil wayne, in a new white tee
meets kd, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me! blaooow
 (who's the king?)
came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
what you expected from me, i came from the dirt
(who's the king?)
money my motivator, the songs that i sing
picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
you tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
will i return or will i burn, never know
look in my eyes and see the future
but don't sugar coat it
 listen
history repeats itself and that's just how it goes
same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
same thing that my nigga elvis did with rock n roll
justin timberlake, eminem, and then macklemore
while silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
this year i’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
 watch iggy win a grammy as i try to crack a smile
i'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
but not jermaine, my aim too sick
i bang nigga, i came to bring the pain my brain too quick
you see how i maneuver this game, i ain't stupid
i recognize that life is a dream, and i dream lucid
and break the chains and change minds, one verse at a time
and claim 2-6, and fuck it, if the shoe fits
who's the king?
 we all kings
(we all kings nigga)
kings of ourselves first and foremost
(true)
while the people debate who's the king of this rap game
here comes lil' ol' jermaine
with every ounce of strength in his veins
to snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
but rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
with a flash and a bang the crown disintegrates
 and falls to the earth from which it came
it's done
ain't gonna be no more kings
be wary of any man that claims
because deep down he clings onto the need for power
but in reality he's a coward
ultimately he's scared to die
and sometimes so am i
but when i'm in tune with the most high
i realize
 the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
today i know that we are the same
are the same, you and i
different kind of skin, different set of eyes
two different minds, but only one god
(it's only one god nigga)
it's for all the kings

filled with marijuana, laughin' hard

you don't know how to express yourself so
you just gotta sing

i just had sex
and it felt so good (felt so good)
a woman let me put my penis inside her (her)
i just had sex (hey!)
and i'll never go back (never go back)
to the not-having-sex
ways of the past
 (andy)
have you ever had sex?
i have, it felt great
it felt so good when i did it with my penis
 a girl let me do it
it literally just happened
having sex could make a nice man out' the meanest
 (jorma)
you'll never guess where i just came from
i had sex
if i had to describe the feeling it was the best
 when i had the sex
'meant my penis felt great
and i called my parents right after i was done
 (andy)
oh hey, didn't see you there
guess what i just did
had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest
 (jorma)
well sure
nice of her to let you do that thing
 (andy)
nice of any girl ever
 (jorma)
now sing
 [akon]
i just had sex
and it felt so good (felt so good)
a woman let me put my penis inside her (her)
i wanna tell the world
 [andy samberg]
to be honest
i'm surprised she even wanted me to do it
 (jorma)
doesn't really make sense
 (andy)
but man, screw it
 (jorma)
i ain't one to argue with a good thing
 (andy)
she could be my wife
 (jorma)
that good?
 (andy)
the best 30 seconds of my life
 (akon)
my life!
 (jorma)
i'm so humbled by a girls ability to let me do her
 (andy)
'cause honestly i'd have sex with a pile of manure
with that in mind the soft, nice-smellin' girl's better
 (jorma)
she let me wear my chain and my turtle neck sweater
 (akon)
so this one's dedicated to them girls
that let us flop around on top of them
if you're near or far, whether short or tall
we wanna thank you all for lettin' us fuck you

she kept looking at her watch
 (akon)
doesn't matter, i had sex

but i cried the whole time
 (akon)
doesn't matter, i had sex
 (jorma)
i think she might have been a racist
 (akon)
doesn't matter, i had sex
 (andy)
she put a bag on my head

still counts
i just had sex
and my dreams came true (dreams came true)
so if you had sex in the last 30 minutes then you're qualified to sing with me
i just had sex (everybody sing!)
and it felt so good (we all had sex!)
a woman let me put my penis inside her (i wanna tell the whole world!)
i just had sex (i just had sex!)

you niggas leeches and serpents
 i think it's good that now the teachers are learning, yeah
your brother said, it was your cousin then him, then you

don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
there's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
man, you might've sold to college kids for nike mercedes
but you act like you sold drugs for escobar in the '80s
i had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded

you come through, you comfort me.
and for my drink you’re my lemon squeeze,
oh, you got flavor, you go good with me.
so boy, don’t play or tease me,
we can be together, you got what i need.

 it's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
just because your bank account gets all figured out
next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
and they ain't major shit
do yourself a favor: kick 'em out
eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
i always say long days is better than long nights
at least in the day you've got shade
in the night its all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
i wish somebody would have told b.i.g. that before march ninth
i used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
'till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe
but i didn't know it was off of infested streets
now he the reason i've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
i guess that's the hunger that got me out
at the top of hotel suites renting the lobbys out, you know?
stuntin' like a bitch, prime night me out
and the girl i've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
that was back when i was seventeen
it's crazy though, 'cause even then i thought i had it all figured out
 it's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
'specially if you've got a vision
or how you could have everything
and still think about everything missing
like i probably remember the times i missed out on
more than the ones i lived
i probably remember the girls that i ain't have
more than the ones i did
but i remain a two timing, one girl on the way
two lyin' and one bed-never too tired
smoke so much i need two lighters
shoppin' overseas i do buy it, who higher?
they taught me that i had to dream, black history month
i wake up and treat the day like stack history month
i'm talkin' malcolm flex, jessie rackson
front of the plane: i'm rozay parks
suv swervin' like it's o.j. car, oh
to me and my dogs is all gettin' out
somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out
that keep remindin' me at the same time
that i still ain't got it all figured out
fact, the only thing i really figured out
is that i'll never have it all figured out, fuck
even when your bank account is all figured out
even when your bank account gets all figured out
even when your best friend gets all trickered out
even when it, all of it, when you still ain't got
 today i woke up and realized every day gets shorter
every minute turns into the longest second, yet never ending
age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you
how old or young minded someone is
cause we all started at the same starting point of a woman's legs
but each have our own finish line
understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized
is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong
better to be in the hall of fame than shame
whether it exists for what you do or not
we create this world so we make what exists
it isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized
and remembered for all the right reasons
mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps

 so now i'm down rosecrans in a caravan
passing alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
i got enough to get me through the traffic jam

i'm thinking bout that sex, thinking bout her thighs
or maybe kissing on her neck, or maybe what positions next
sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts
i looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into corvette
enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
and i'm a professional porn star when off the goose
i had a fifth in the trunk like curtis jackson for ransom
i'm hoping to get her loose like an uncle luke anthem
i'm two blocks away, 250 feet
and six steps from where she stay, she waving me 'cross the street

i seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
life is long as infinity this was the final calling
no birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
we all nervous and crying, moving in caution
in disbeliefs our believe's the reason for all this
the tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
the ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
with a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
the smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
preachers touching on boys run for cover, they paranoid
rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
valleys and high places turn into dust
famous screaming in agony
atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling ""he's alive""
backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(it's happening) no more running from world wars
(it's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(it's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
i swore i seen it vividly
a moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
thunder like number four, then i heard
""what have you did for me""
i fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
that dated back to june 17th, 1987
my paperwork was like a receipt
i was valedictorian, i was fearful of judgment
but confident i had glory in all my past endeavors
close my eyes pray to god that i live forever
dark skies, fire and brimstone some of us sent home
some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
geez louise i thought you said that i excel
i made to pimp a butterfly 'fore you told me
to use my vocals to save man-kind for you
say i didn't try for you, say i didn't ride for you
i tied for you, i pushed the club to the side for you
who love you like i love you?
crucifix, tell me you can fix
anytime i need, i'mma start jotting everything in my diary
never would you lie to me
always camaraderie, i can see, our days been numbered
revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
all man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
i guess i'm running in place trying to make it to church

 look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
trapped inside your desire
to fire bullets that stray
track attire just tell you i'm tired and ran away
i should ask a choir what do you require
to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
as the record spin i should pray
for the record i recognize that i'm easily prey
i got ate alive yesterday
i got animosity building
it's probably big as a building
me jumping off of the roof
is me just playing it safe
but what am i supposed to do
when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that i ain't
but know i'm accustomed to
just a couple that look for trouble
and live in the street with rank
no better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
and called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
from a function that tooken place
they was wondering if i bang
step on my neck and get blood on your nike checks
i don't mind because one day you'll respect

blinding me in my hindsight
finding me by myself
promise me you can help
in all honesty i got time to be copacetic until
you had finally made decision to hold me against my will
it was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
i can never pick out the difference
and grade a cop on the bill
every time you clock in the morning
i feel you just want to kill
all my innocence while ignoring my purpose
to persevere as a better person
i know you heard this and probably in fear
but what am i supposed to do
with the blinking of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof
and your dog has to say woof
and you ask: lift up your shirt
cause you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
i heard them chatter: he's probably young but i know that he's down
step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest

i quietly hope for change
when violence is the rhythm
inspired me to obtain
the silence in this room
with 20 xanies and 'shrooms

i say what i wanna say
when i feel, and i
look in the mirror and know i'm there
with my hands in the air
i'm proud to say yea
i'm real, i'm real, i'm really really real
 i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they tell
sweet lullabies that come with a smell
of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
you living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a never relay a guarantee
and plan c never could say just what it was
and your plans only can pan around love
you love him, you love them, you love her
you love so much, you love when love hurts
you love red-bottom and gold they say queen
you love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
you love french tip and trip that pay for
you love bank slip that tell you we paid more
you love a good hand whenever the card dealt
but what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself
 i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they fell
out the sky and your optics turn stale
where they mold that's green
i can see you fit the bill
of living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a only can make another mistake
and you can't see success coming from plan c
when it all breaks you, you still say you're lovely
and love them and love when you love her
you love so much, you love when love hurts
you love fast cars and dead presidents old
you love fast women
you love keepin' control
of everything you love, you love beef
you love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
you love your hood, might even love it to death
but what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
 the reason why i know you very well
cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
the days i tried to cover up and conceal
my pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
when living in a world that come with plan b
a scapegoat cause plan a don't come free
and plan c just an excuse like because
or the word but, but what if i got love?
i love them, i love when i love her
i love so much, i love when love hurts
i love first verse cause you're the girl i attract
i love second verse cause your the homie that packed
burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
i love what the both of you have to offer
in fact, i love it so much
i don't love anything else
but what love got to do with it when i don't love myself
to the point i should hate everything i do love
should i hate living my life inside the club
should i hate her for watching me for that reason
should i hate him for telling me that i'm season
should i hate them for telling me ball out
should i hate street credibility i'm talkin' about
hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
or hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real
 kenny i ain't trippin' off that dominos anymore
just calling, sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy
but don't learn the hard way like i did homie
any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga
real is responsibility, real is taking care of your motherfucking family
real is god, nigga
 alright that's all i wanted to tell you
just make sure you call us back when you get this message
here go your mom
 boy you better have my car
on full all this time you done had my damn car
but look i ain't trippin
look, the neighbors say they seen you
and your little friends over there by the food for less
and they was preaching to you over there telling you
about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need
 oh, and top dawg called the house too
i guess they want you and dave to come to the studio
but look, you take this music business serious
and put out something me and your dad can step to
shit, you know we from chicago you know that's what we do
 sing my song, it's all for you
 if i don't hear from you, by tomorrow
i hope you come back, and learn from your mistakes
come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in compton
let 'em know you was just like them
but you still rose from that dark place of violence
becoming a positive person
but when you do make it, give back
with your words of encouragement

knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
cover my ears, my security government tier
yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
check the guest list
if opps make an appearance at least it’s expected
tell ‘em i don’t wanna link like a broken necklace
i’ll be in better company with my own reflection
mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the royal palace

give me the right brush and i draw all
i promise i been thinkin before ya'll

'cause a lotta broke niggas 'round the way ridin' 'round town
and they lookin' for my face
gotta pray to god above you, girl, you know that savage love you
and i hope that you feel the same
tryna be the one for you, but my nickname true
and i hope that i can change
girl, you know that savage love you, girl, you know that savage love you
 gotta turn my bitch up, turn my bitch up
turn my bitch up, turn my bitch up
turn my bitch up, turn my bitch up
turn my bitch up, turn my—

i like it, but i'm too geeked, tryna turn you up
i gotta stop goin' lenci', rollie, first week
you're misreadin' me, i'm too geeked, tryna turn you up
you were lost until me
i didn't get no finder's fee
you're actin' like a bride-to-be
behind closed doors, slimin' me
friends are all advisin' me
sayin' i could die tryna turn you up
there's three sides to this story, girl
the one you subtweet
the one your group chat gets to read
the one you come and tell to me
i understand it finally
i'm tryin' to give you highs and you're plannin' our goodbyes
but i turn you up
it's my fault
burnin' cash like it's lit on fire
penthouse and some new attire
i fulfilled all of your desires
you don't work, but you act retired
'cause you know that you're mine and it's my fault
it's my fault, it's my fault, for once i take accountability
it's my fault that you got superpowers on your knees
it's my fault for once, don't keep you grounded on your feet
it's my fault for once, i drain accounts to make you love me
it's my fault for once, it's one-sided loyalty
my fault for once, i'm payin' lawyer fees
doin' things just to set you free, see you breathe
it's my fault for once, i got the wagon, g
got you ridin' 'round with niggas that are nothin' like me
it's my fault for once, that's how you make it seem
it's my fault, it's my fault
 you were lost until me
you were lost until me
you were lost until me
 my confidence is super low
baby m, you know i got a heart of gold
you pawned that shit and hit the road, baby
for goodness sakes, at this rate
your funeral is finna have like ten caskets on display
one for you, the other nine for everything you're takin' to the grave
you don't play, you don't, you don't, you
you don't play no games
there's three things i learned from love for free
only thing really worth chasing is a dream
people don't know you play your roles on screen
messy, started gettin' trendy, gotta keep it clean
you know i keep it clean
clean as i can
all weapons formed against me gotta jam
brought you 'round the dawgs, treat you like the fam'
shoulda been a wham, bam, thank you ma'am
know you got my confidence on sale
case you wanna feel better 'bout yourself
 you were lost until me
you were lost until me",1.0,0.4166666666666667,3.9499999999999598,2.823031,1.6291091007823821,768,1.063157894736842,0.13765312701482915,1

You know, like I always do<br/>I play the songs, he's like  Who that spittin? <br/>I'm like  It's me.  He's like  Oh, well okay. <br/>Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone<br/>Going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats<br/>And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers<br/>Cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with<br/>And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID<br/>And No ID told him,   look man, you wanna mess with Kanye<br/>You need to tell him that you like the way he rap  <br/>Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap  <br/>I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not<br/>But he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer<br/>I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper<br/>I'm like oh shit<br/>I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also<br/>People were like this, started talking about the Ghost<br/>Production<br/>But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I<br/>Wouldn't be here<br/>So you know. After they picked that Truth beat<br/>I was figuring I was gonna do some more work<br/>But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in<br/>Chicago<br/>I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local<br/>Acts</p><p>Just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy<br/>Get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something<br/>Or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then<br/>I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample<br/>I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like oh, yo that shit<br/>Is crazy<br/>Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The<br/>Dynasty.  <br/>And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right<br/>To me<br/>So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that<br/>Time<br/>And really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put<br/>It like<br/>With it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole<br/>Style<br/>When it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life. '<br/>And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was<br/>On the Dynasty album</p><p>I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound<br/>You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time<br/>I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll<br/>With<br/>Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what<br/>I'm<br/>Sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they<br/>Did<br/>For me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where<br/>He<br/>Gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that<br/>Day I<br/>Came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said<br/>Oh<br/>You a real soulful dude [Jay-Z: you a real soulful dude]. And<br/>He<br/>Uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time<br/>I got<br/>To the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said<br/>Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right<br/>Here<br/>Tell me what you think of this. And I heard it, and I was<br/>Thinking<br/>Like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I<br/>Ain't<br/>Want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the<br/>In my Personal opinion. So he asked me,  what you think of it? <br/>So what you thinkin?<br/>And I was like, man that shit tite<br/>You know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the<br/>Train<br/>Man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm<br/>Just<br/>In Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I<br/>Got<br/>Acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really<br/>Like<br/>Poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that<br/>Was one<br/>Of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go<br/>Through<br/>My production company, but he ended up going straight with the<br/>Company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin'<br/>The bad<br/>News that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted<br/>At<br/>The same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I<br/>Took<br/>That money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe<br/>About<br/>Ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to<br/>Deal<br/>With the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to<br/>[Mother:]  Come on, let's just go <br/>Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment<br/>I remember I pulled up<br/>[Mother:]  Kanye, baby, we're here <br/>I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a<br/>Bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my<br/>Equipment, and<br/>The first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City. '<br/>And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came<br/>Up<br/>There to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and<br/>I<br/>Played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the<br/>Zone<br/>He already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like<br/>Already at<br/>That time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI<br/>Bucket<br/>Hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop<br/>Said<br/>Yo play that one beat for him. And I played 'Heart of the<br/>City. ' And<br/>Really I made 'Heart of the City, ' I really wanted to give that<br/>Beat to DMX<br/>[Hiphop:] No I think Jay gon' like this one right here<br/>And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I<br/>Remember that<br/>GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made<br/>One of<br/>Them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH. ' Two days later I'm in Baseline<br/>And I seen<br/>Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like yo what's up<br/>I'm Kanye<br/>[Dame:] Yo, you that kid, Kanye?<br/>You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?<br/>Yo, this nigga got classics<br/>[Dame:]   Jay got classics, G<br/>You know I ain't talkin shit<br/>I'm like oh shit. And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm<br/>Still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the<br/>Show<br/>The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in<br/>My<br/>Eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit<br/>All<br/>These songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up<br/>One<br/>Thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the<br/>'Can't be<br/>Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis<br/>Vuitton<br/>Sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think<br/>Tata, John<br/>Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at<br/>The<br/>Time they was in the room, and I said, yo Jay I could rap. And<br/>I<br/>Spit this rap that said, uh I'm killin y'all niggaz on that<br/>Lyrical<br/>Shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips. And I saw<br/>His<br/>Eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the<br/>Rap<br/>Was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response<br/>He said man that was tite<br/>[Jay-Z:] That, that was cool. That was hot<br/>That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe<br/>Okay, fast forward<br/>So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just<br/>Took that proudly, built relationships with people. My<br/>Relationship<br/>With KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to<br/>My<br/>Career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he<br/>Allowed me<br/>To go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And<br/>At<br/>This time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I<br/>Had<br/>Relationships with all these A&amp;R's, and they wanted beats from<br/>Me, so<br/>They'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. Gimme a beat that<br/>Sound<br/>Like Jay-Z. You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play<br/>Them<br/>These post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my<br/>Shit. I'll<br/>Be like, yo but I rap too. Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me<br/>Crazy<br/>'Cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever<br/>Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and<br/>They<br/>Didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&amp;R's that<br/>Fucked<br/>With me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at<br/>The<br/>Company that'll say naw. Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my<br/>Nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man<br/>[Jessica:] Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye<br/>For real<br/>I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up<br/>Y'all niggaz is stupid. Let's just say I didn't get my deal<br/>The nigga that was behind me, I mean<br/>He wasn't even a nigga, you know?<br/>The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from<br/>Capitol<br/>Records. He wanted to sign me really bad<br/>[Joe:] We gonna change the game, buddy<br/>Dame was like, yo you got a deal with Capitol<br/>Okay man, just make sure it's not wack<br/>[Dame:] you gotta make sure it's not wack<br/>Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to<br/>Play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young<br/>Guru, and<br/>Dame was in the room. So I played actually it's a song that<br/>You'll<br/>Never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow. '<br/>I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow<br/>I got eleven plaques on my walls right now<br/>You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow<br/>Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use<br/>It. So<br/>I play that song for him, and he's like oh shit<br/>[Dame:] Oh shit it's not even wack<br/>I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot<br/>[Dame:] it's actually kinda hot<br/>Like they still weren't looking at me<br/>Like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a<br/>Whole<br/>Album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every<br/>Song and<br/>Save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office<br/>And he's<br/>Like yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick<br/>[Dame:] you don't wanna catch a brick<br/>You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on<br/>I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, oh, word? Actually, even<br/>With<br/>That I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it<br/>Was<br/>Already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H<br/>That, you<br/>Know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my<br/>Word, I<br/>Was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know<br/>I'm<br/>Not gonna name no names, but people told me, oh he's just a<br/>Producer<br/>Rapper and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and<br/>Right<br/>The day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna<br/>Do<br/>Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio<br/>Sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing<br/>Schemes<br/>Man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said<br/>Yo, Capitol pulled on the deal<br/>[Mel:] Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal<br/>And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested<br/>And I don't know if they thought that was just something I was<br/>Saying<br/>To gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went<br/>Up, I<br/>Called G, I said, man, you think we could still get that deal<br/>With Rocafella?</p> ",RAP,"yo fuck you, kanye, first and foremost

mayonnaise colored benz, i push miracle whips
  ... last call for alcohol, for my niggaz 
 so this a&amp;r over at rocafella, named hiphop
picked the truth beat for beanie. and i was in the session with
him
i had my demo with me. you know, like i always do
i play the songs, he's like  who that spittin? 
i'm like  it's me.  he's like  oh, well okay. 
uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone
going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats
and i'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers
cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin with
and um, he was friends with my mentor, no id
and no id told him,   look man, you wanna mess with kanye
you need to tell him that you like the way he rap  
yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap  
i was all, i dunno if he was gassin' me or not
but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer
i'll sign you as a producer and a rapper
i'm like oh shit
i was messin with, uh, d-dot also
people were like this, started talking about the ghost
production
but that's how i got in the game. if it wasn't for that, i
wouldn't be here
so you know. after they picked that truth beat
i was figuring i was gonna do some more work
but shit just went poppin off like that. i was stayin in
chicago
i had my own apartment. i be doin' like, just beats for local
acts
 just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy
get a pelle pelle off lay-away, get some jordans or something
or get a technomarine, that's what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i sped up this hal melville sample
i played it for hip over the phone, he's like oh, yo that shit
is crazy
jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called the
dynasty.  
and at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right
to me
so i went and um, i was listening to dre chronic 2001 at that
time
and really i just, like picked the drums off xxplosive and put
it like
with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole
style
when it started, when he rapped on 'this can't be life. '
and that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was
on the dynasty album
 i could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound
you know, i got to come in and track the beat, and at the time
i was still with my other management. i really wanted to roll
with
hiphop. 'cause i, i just needed some fresh air, you know what
i'm
sayin, 'cause i been there for a while, i appreciated what they
did
for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where
he
gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. and that
day i
came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jay-z and he said
oh
you a real soulful dude [jay-z: you a real soulful dude]. and
he
uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time
i got
to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. and he said
check this out, tell me what you think of this, right
here
tell me what you think of this. and i heard it, and i was
thinking
like, man, i really wanted more like of the simple type jay-z, i
ain't
want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the
in my personal opinion. so he asked me,  what you think of it? 
so what you thinkin?
and i was like, man that shit tite
you know what i'm sayin', man what i'ma tell him? i was on the
train
man, you know. so after that i went back home. and man i'm, i'm
just
in chicago, i'm trying to do my thing. you know, i got groups. i
got
acts i'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really
like
poppin' off the way it should have been. one of my homeys that
was one
of my artists, he got signed. but it was supposed to really go
through
my production company, but he ended up going straight with the
company. so, like i'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin'
the bad
news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. and i got evicted
at
the same time. so i went down and tracked the beats from him, i
took
that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a u-haul, maybe
about
ten days before i had to actually get out. so i ain't have to
deal
with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. me and my mother drove to
[mother:]  come on, let's just go 
newark, new jersey. i hadn't even seen my apartment
i remember i pulled up
[mother:]  kanye, baby, we're here 
i unpacked all my shit. you know, we went to ikea, i bought a
bed, i put the bed together myself. i loaded up all my
equipment, and
the first beat i made was, uh, 'heart of the city. '
and beans was still working on his album at that time, so i came
up
there to baseline, it was beans' birthday, matter of fact, and
i
played like seven beats. and, you know i could see he's in the
zone
he already had the beats that he wanted, i did nothing like
already at
that time. but then jay walked in. i remember he had a gucci
bucket
hat on. i remember it like, like it was yesterday. and hiphop
said
yo play that one beat for him. and i played 'heart of the
city. ' and
really i made 'heart of the city, ' i really wanted to give that
beat to dmx
[hiphop:] no i think jay gon' like this one right here
and i played another beat, and i played another beat. and i
remember that
gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made
one of
them faces like 'ooooooooooh. ' two days later i'm in baseline
and i seen
dame. dame didn't know who i was and i was like yo what's up
i'm kanye
[dame:] yo, you that kid, kanye?
you that kid that gave all them beats to jay?
yo, this nigga got classics
[dame:]   jay got classics, g
you know i ain't talkin shit
i'm like oh shit. and all this time i'm starstruck, man. i'm
still thinking 'bout, you know i'm picturing these niggaz on the
show
the streets is watching, i'm lookin, these were superstars in
my
eyes. and they still are, you know. so, jay came in and he spit
all
these songs like in one day, and in two days... i gotta bring up
one
thing, you know, come back to the story, the day i did the
'can't be
life' beat on track, i remember lenny s, he had some louis
vuitton
sneakers on, he think he fly. and hiphop was there, i think
tata, john
minnelli, a bunch of people. i didn't know all these people at
the
time they was in the room, and i said, yo jay i could rap. and
i
spit this rap that said, uh i'm killin y'all niggaz on that
lyrical
shit. mayonnaise colored benz, i push miracle whips. and i saw
his
eyes light up when i said that line. but you know the west, the
rap
was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response
he said man that was tite
[jay-z:] that, that was cool. that was hot
that was it. you know, i ain't get no deal then, hehe
okay, fast forward
so, blueprint, h to the izzo, my first hit single. and i just
took that proudly, built relationships with people. my
relationship
with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to
my
career as a rapper. because, you know, of course later he
allowed me
to go on tour with him. man, i appre-- i love him for that. and
at
this time, you know i didn't have a deal, i had songs, and i
had
relationships with all these a&amp;r's, and they wanted beats from
me, so
they'd call me up, i'd play them some beats. gimme a beat that
sound
like jay-z. you know, they dick riders. whatever. so i'll play
them
these post-blueprint beats or whatever and then i'll play my
shit. i'll
be like, yo but i rap too. hey, i guess they was lookin' at me
crazy
'cause you know, 'cause i ain't have a jersey on or whatever
everybody out there listen here. i played them 'jesus walks' and
they
didn't sign me. you know what happened, it was some a&amp;r's that
fucked
with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at
the
company that'll say naw. like, dave lotti fucked with me, my
nigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels. jessica rivera, man
[jessica:] man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign kanye
for real
i'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up
y'all niggaz is stupid. let's just say i didn't get my deal
the nigga that was behind me, i mean
he wasn't even a nigga, you know?
the person who actually kicked everything off was joe 3h from
capitol
records. he wanted to sign me really bad
[joe:] we gonna change the game, buddy
dame was like, yo you got a deal with capitol
okay man, just make sure it's not wack
[dame:] you gotta make sure it's not wack
then one day i just went ahead and played it, i wanted to
play some songs, 'cause you know cam was in the room, young
guru, and
dame was in the room. so i played actually it's a song that
you'll
never hear, but maybe i might use it. so, it's called 'wow. '
i go to jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
i got eleven plaques on my walls right now
you got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow
like the chorus went. don't bite that chorus, i might still use
it. so
i play that song for him, and he's like oh shit
[dame:] oh shit it's not even wack
i ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot
[dame:] it's actually kinda hot
like they still weren't looking at me
like a rapper. and i'm sure dame figured, 'like man. if he do a
whole
album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every
song and
save the album, you know. so uh dame took me into the office
and he's
like yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick
[dame:] you don't wanna catch a brick
you gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on
i told hiphop and hiphop was all, oh, word? actually, even
with
that i was still about to take the deal with capitol 'cause it
was
already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3h
that, you
know, 'cause i told him i was gonna do it, and i'm a man of my
word, i
was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do. then, you know
i'm
not gonna name no names, but people told me, oh he's just a
producer
rapper and told 3h that told the heads of the capitol, and
right
the day i'm talking about, i planned out everything i was gonna
do
man, i had picked out clothes, i already started booking studio
sessions, i started arranging my album, thinking of marketing
schemes
man i was ready to go. and they had mel call me, they said
yo, capitol pulled on the deal
[mel:] yo, capitol pulled out on the deal
and, you know i told them that rocafella was interested
and i don't know if they thought that was just something i was
saying
to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. i went
up, i
called g, i said, man, you think we could still get that deal
with rocafella?",12.0,0.3163265306122449,13.489999999999757,2.6450515,1.7863873469849925,2646,1.021671826625387,0.09908691735614815,1

 i said keep reading my diary, when my life's entirely
surrounded by the irony of livin' in the city
i said they wouldn't hire me
i said i got my ass beat
and the only thing can help is ass and some titties
so whassup baby?
i said whassup? i had a long day and i really wanna fuck
see i ain't tryna think about no phone bills, credit card late fees
capital one poppin' up on my caller id
corner my chain in the shop
watchin' for hollow tip shots
watchin' my vehicle break down on another man's block
man that's my worst fear
ain't that your worst fear?
you know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
or run through a pothole at 2 in the morning
scared to hit your emergencies cause them they'll be on it
see i know, when the harsh reality take it's toll
open up your contacts then scroll
 i'm goin' through something with life

pussy and patron that's some great advice
 welcome to my diary
hmmm, where should i begin?
finna get a swisher and, fill it with that leaves the ground
crackas watch my every step
better yet they work my every nerve
cuttin' me this worthless check
the concept is so absurd
like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtle neck
convertibles with turbo jets
fueled by 7-up and prometh
i feel like death's around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
so i took another shot
tequila hit me like a nina (blaow!)
my sky's gray
my bitches brighter always sayin': lights please!
j. cole's her ghost writer
and i'm the god mc
join my diocese
free ya mind, don't mind so-ciety
and finally, everyone got their own, problems
everything is subject to change like broken dollars
