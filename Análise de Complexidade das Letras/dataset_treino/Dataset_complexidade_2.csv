as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga
 ""i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power, full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in the hotel room
i didn’t wanna self destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
 but that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
or maybe how a-1 my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting
the continuous war back in the city, i was entering a new one
a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
made me wanna go back to the city
and tell the homies what i learned
the word was respect
 just because you wore a different gang colour than mines
doesn’t mean i can’t respect you as a black man
forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
if i respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
but i don’t know, i’m no mortal man, maybe i’m just another nigga”
shit and that’s all i wrote
i was gonna call another nigga but, it ain’t really a poem
i just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
 other than that, now that i finally got a chance to holla at you
i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa
about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground
what you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent?
the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
that’s how i see it, my word is bon
i see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
the poor people is gonna open up this whole world
and swallow up the rich people
 cause the rich people gonna be so fat
they gonna be so appetising, you know what i’m saying
wealthy, appetising. the poor gonna be so poor and hungry
you know what i’m saying it’s gonna be like
there might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich
 aight so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself
as somebody that’s rich or somebody that made
the best of their own opportunities?
i see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler
in every sense of the word. i took nothin’, i took the opportunities
i worked at the most menial and degrading job
and built myself up so i could get it to where
 i owned it. i went from having somebody
manage me to me hiring the person that works
my management company. i changed everything i realised my destiny in a matter of five years you know what i’m saying i made myself a millionaire. i made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what i’m saying. i made millions for the record companies, i made millions for these movie companies, now i make millions for us
and through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
 by my faith in god, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true. you know what i’m saying, and it was happening to me for a reason, you know what i’m saying, i was noticing, i was punching the right buttons and it was happening. so it’s no problem, you know i mean it’s a problem but i’m not finna let them know. i’m finna go straight through

that’s crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?
 shit, i think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it’s a riot there’s gonna be bloodshed for real. i don’t think america can know that. i think american think we was just playing and it’s gonna be some more playing but it ain’t gonna be no playing. it’s gonna be murder, you know what i’m saying, it’s gonna be like nat turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka. you know what i’m saying, it’s gonna happen
 that’s crazy man. in my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations, lotta people don’t understand how important it is. sometimes i be like, get behind a mic and i don’t know what type of energy i’mma push out, or where it comes from. trip me out sometimes
because the spirits, we ain’t really rappin’,
we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
damn
i wanted to read one last thing to you
it’s actually something a good friend
had wrote describing my world. it says
“the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
in order to protect itself from this mad city
while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
the butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar
sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar
goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
he can no longer see past his own thoughts
he’s trapped
when trapped inside these walls certain ideas
start to take roots, such as going home
and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
 the result?
wings begin to emerge, breaking
the cycle of feeling stagnant
finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
that the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle
although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely
different, they are one and the same.""
what’s your perspective on that?

and it's my turn to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
 i said when the lights shut off
and it's my turn to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
 i woke up this morning and figured i'd call you
in case i'm not here tomorrow
i'm hopin' that i can borrow
a peace of mind, i'm behind on what's really important
my mind is really distorted
i find nothing but trouble in my life
i'm fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction
or a reaction of what we consider madness
i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
but the type of bullet that stuck
had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
my plan's rather vindictive
everybody's a victim in my eyes
when i ride, it's a murderous rhythm
and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back, whisperin': get 'em!
i got 'em and i ain't give a fuck
that same mentality i told my brother not to duck
in actuality, it's a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if i'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a youngin in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
when thunder comes, it rains cats and dogs dumb
niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child, i'm proud and well-devoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever i'ma push it, wherever, whenever
and i love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop, i hope
 promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
 i said when the lights shut off
and it's my turn to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
 you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it section.80
the message resembled brenda's got a baby
what's crazy was i was hearin' about it, but doubted your ignorance
how could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
judgin' her past and shit?
well, it's completely my future
her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
and i'ma need that forty dollars
even if i got to fuck, suck and swallow
in the parking lot, gonzales park, i'm followed
by a married man and father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with e's
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes, i run away and never do miss 'em
see, my hormones just run away and if i can get 'em
back to where they used to be, then i'll probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
then you probably need to beat her, that's how i was taught
three niggas in one room, first time i was tossed
and i'm exhausted, but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
my sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
if you can't fit the pumps i walk in?
i'll wait
your rebuttal a little too late
 and if you have a album date, just make sure i'm not in the song
'cause i don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact, did i mention that i physically feel great?
a doctor's approval is a waste of time, i know i'm straight
i'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
i'll never fade away, i'll never fade away, i know my fate
and i'm on the grind for this cake, i'ma get it or die tryin'
i'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
you lyin' to these motherfuckers
talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit
 when the lights shut off
and it's my turn to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
 i said when the lights shut off
and it's my turn to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
 sometimes i look in the mirror
and ask myself: am i really scared of passin' away?
if it's today, i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost 'til it drown in the blood of jesus
 i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
the scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon, and if i'm doomed
may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot
and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
i tie my stomach in knots
and i'm not sure why i'm infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe 'cause i'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when i'ma rest
 and you're right, your brother was a brother to me
and your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the tv screen
by any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
her personal life, i was like: it need to be told
cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
exactly what'd happen if i ain't continue rappin'
or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
i count lives, all on these songs
look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
fightin' for your rights even when you're wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i'm gone
am i worth it? did i put enough work in?
 promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
 i said when the lights shut off
and it's my turn to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me

 dope on the corner, look at the coroner
daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
stray bullets, ak bullets
resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
bring her back, who got the footage?

i know i'm good at
dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst
 how many sins? i'm runnin' out
how many sins? i lost count
dreams of ballin' like spalding, but only shotty bounce
the reaper callin', i'm cottonmouth
money is power (money is power)
yours is ours (yours is ours)
lay with a snitch, die with a coward
hope we get rich, hope we can tower
over the city with vanity, with the music louder
the same song, a black flower
i'll show you how to
dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst
 what are we doin'? who are we foolin'?
hell is hot, fire is proven
to burn for eternity, return of the student
that never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'

whatever it is, know it's my next grave
 tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' backwards

what if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
the truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
you dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst

now
 when i was 27, i grew accustomed to more fear
accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
my newfound life made all of me magnified
how many accolades do i need to block denial?
the shock value of my success put bolts in me
all this money, is god playin' a joke on me?
is it for the moment, and will he see me as job?
take it from me and leave me worse than i was before?
at 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
scared to go back to section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and i still won't buy me no lexus
 what is an advisor? somebody that's holdin' my checks
just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
i read a case about rihanna's accountant and wondered
how did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
the type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil somethin'
i practiced runnin' from fear, guess i had some good luck
at 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
how they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
what they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
what they see from me would trickle down generations in time
what they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
 i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
i'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'cause my dna won't let me involve in the light of god
 i'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
i'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
i'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
 fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me, so, hopefully, they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
 fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me, so, hopefully, they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
wonderin' if i'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
damn
 god damn you
god damn me
god damn us
god damn we
 god damn us all
 verse 2 says
you only have i known of all the families of the earth
therefore, i will punish you for all your iniquities
so until we come back to these commandments
until you come back to these commandments
we gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
because he said he's gonna punish us
the so-called blacks, hispanics and native american indians
are the true children of israel
we are the israelites, according to the bible
the children of israel
he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
because we chose to follow other gods
that man chastens his son, so the lord, thy god, chasten thee
so, just like you chasten your own son, he's gonna chasten you
because he loves you, so that's why we get chastised
that's why we're in the position that we're in
until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments
and do what the lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
we gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
here, in today, in the united states of america
 i love you, family, and i pray for you
god bless you

into the mothafuckin' rock n' roll hall of fame
even though i'll walk in the church
and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame i'll be inducted in
is the alcohol of fame, on the wall of shame
you fags think it's all a game
'til i walk a flock of flames off a plank
and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
 little gay-looking boy
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy
you're witnessing a mass-occur
like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy
you get a thumbs up, pat on the back
and a way to go from your label every day, looking boy
hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy
i get a hell, yeah from dre, looking boy
i'ma work for everything i have, never ask nobody for shit
get outta my face, looking boy
basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
to keep it up with the same pace, looking boy
 'cause i'm beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
the way i'm racing around the track, call me nascar, nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park, the white trash god
kneel before general zod this planet's krypton, no asgard, asgard
 so you be thor and i'll be odin
you rodent, i'm omnipotent
let off then i'm reloading immediately
with these bombs i'm toting
and i should not be woken, i'm the walking dead
but i'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
but i got your mom deep throating
 i'm out my ramen noodle
we have nothing in common, poodle
i'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm
and pay homage, pupil
it's me, my honesty's brutal, but it's honestly futile
if i don't utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
 so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch
i scribble and doodle enough rhymes
to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case, 'cause even you unsigned rappers
are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
i know there was a time
where once i was king of the underground
but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
 appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come trying to censor you
like that one line i said on i'm back, from the mathers lp
one when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine
put 'em all in a line, add an ak-47, a revolver and a nine
 see, if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was
but i'm morphing into an immortal, coming through the portal
you're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
you're pointless as rapunzel with fucking cornrows
you write normal? fuck being normal
 and i just bought a new raygun from the future
just to come and shoot you
like when fabolous made ray j mad
'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad
singing to a man while they played piano
 man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station
the very next day: hey fab, i'ma kill you!
lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (j.j. fad)
 uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming i'm a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you? i'm superhuman
innovative and i'm made of rubber
so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me
and it'll glue to you
 and i'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
how to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
never fading, and i know the haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off, they'll be celebrating
'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated
i make elevating music, you make elevator music
 oh, he's too mainstream
well, that's what they do when they get jealous
they confuse it
it's not hip-hop, it's pop
'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock
shock rap with doc
 throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it
i don't know how to make songs like that
i don't know what words to use
let me know when it occurs to you
while i'm ripping any one of these verses
that versus you, it's curtains
i'm inadvertently hurting you
how many verses i gotta murder to
 prove that if you were half as nice your songs
you could sacrifice virgins too
school flunky, pill junky
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself, but still hungry
i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to
and i'm a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues
 but it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
i'm drunk, so satan take the fucking wheel
i'm asleep in the front seat
bumping heavy d and the boyz
still chunky, but funky
but in my head there's something
i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils
and here's what they want from me
 they're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i had
then you may be a little patient
and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
 but fuck it, life's handing you lemons
make lemonade then, but if i can't batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then?
don't mistake him for satan, it's a fatal mistake
if you think i need to be overseas
and take a vacation to trip abroad
and make her fall on her face
and don't be a retard
be a king? think not
why be a king when you can be a god?",10.0,0.4284781188765513,7.779999999999879,2.6712623,1.3679783715923957,1531,1.0217391304347827,-0.0493775354624411,1

and in comes romeo, he's moaning
you belong to me i believe
and someone says: you're in the wrong place, my friend

after the ambulances go
is cinderella sweeping up

the fortunetelling lady
has even taken all her things inside
all except for cain and abel

he's getting ready for the show
he's going to the carnival tonight

 now ophelia, she's 'neath the window
for her i feel so afraid
on her twenty-second birthday
she already is an old maid
 to her, death is quite romantic
she wears an iron vest
her profession's her religion
her sin is her lifelessness
and though her eyes are fixed upon
noah's great rainbow
she spends her time peeking
into desolation row
 einstein, disguised as robin hood
with his memories in a trunk
passed this way an hour ago
with his friend, a jealous monk
he looked so immaculately frightful
as he bummed a cigarette
then he went off sniffing drainpipes
and reciting the alphabet
now you would not think to look at him
but he was famous long ago
for playing the electric violin
on desolation row
 dr. filth, he keeps his world
inside of a leather cup
but all his sexless patients
they're trying to blow it up
now his nurse, some local loser
she's in charge of the cyanide hole
and she also keeps the cards that read
have mercy on his soul
they all play on penny whistles
you can hear them blow
if you lean your head out far enough
from desolation row
 across the street they've nailed the curtains
they're getting ready for the feast
the phantom of the opera
a perfect image of a priest
they're spoonfeeding casanova
to get him to feel more assured
then they'll kill him with self-confidence
after poisoning him with words
 and the phantom's shouting to skinny girls
get outa here if you don't know
casanova is just being punished for going
to desolation row
 now at midnight all the agents
and the superhuman crew
come out and round up everyone
that knows more than they do
then they bring them to the factory
where the heart-attack machine
is strapped across their shoulders
and then the kerosene
is brought down from the castles
by insurance men who go
check to see that nobody is escaping
to desolation row

i was laying in bed
wondering if she'd changed at all
if her hair was still red
 her folks they said our lives together
sure was going to be rough
they never did like mama's homemade dress
papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
 and i was standing on the side of the road
rain falling on my shoes
heading out for the east coast
lord knows i've paid some dues
getting through
tangled up in blue
 she was married when we first met
soon to be divorced
i helped her out of a jam, i guess
but i used a little too much force
 we drove that car as far as we could
abandoned it out west
split up on a dark sad night
both agreeing it was best
 she turned around to look at me
as i was walking away
i heard her say over my shoulder
we'll meet again someday on the avenue
tangled up in blue
 i had a job in the great north woods
working as a cook for a spell
but i never did like it all that much
and one day the ax just fell
 so i drifted down to new orleans
where i lucky was to be employed
working for a while on a fishing boat
right outside of delacroix
 but all the while i was alone
the past was close behind
i've seen a lot of women
but she never escaped my mind
and i just grew
tangled up in blue
 she was working in a topless place
and i stopped in for a beer
i just kept looking at the side of her face
in the spotlight, so clear
 and later on, when the crowd thinned out
i was just about to do the same
she was standing there, in the back of my chair
said to me: tell me, don't i know your name?
 i muttered something underneath my breath
she studied the lines on my face
i must admit, i felt a little uneasy
when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
tangled up in blue
 she lit a burner on the stove
and offered me a pipe
i thought you'd never say hello, she said
you look like the silent type
 then she opened up a book of poems
and handed it to me
written by an italian poet
from the thirteenth century
 and every one of them words rang true
and glowed like burning coal
pouring off of every page
like it was written in my soul from me to you
tangled up in blue
 i lived with them on montague street
in a basement down the stairs
there was music in the cafés at night
and revolution in the air
 then he started into dealing with slaves
and something inside of him died
she had to sell everything she owned
and froze up inside
 and when it finally, the bottom fell out
i became withdrawn
the only thing i knew how to do was to keep on keeping on
like a bird that flew
tangled up in blue
 so now i'm going back again
i got to get to her somehow
all the people we used to know
they're an illusion to me now
 some are mathematicians
some are carpenter's wives
don't know how it all got started
i don't know what they're doing with their lives
 but me, i'm still on the road
a-heading for another joint
we always did feel the same
we just saw it from a different point of view

enter patty valentine from the upper hall
she sees the bartender in a pool of blood
cries out, my god, they've killed them all!
 here comes the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for somethin' that he never done
put in a prison cell
but one time he could'a been
the champion of the world
 three bodies lyin' there does patty see
and another man named bello
movin' around mysteriously
i didn't do it, he says
and he throws up his hands
i was only robbin' the register
i hope you understand
 i saw them leavin', he says, and he stops
one of us had better call up the cops
and so patty calls the cops
and they arrive on the scene
with their red lights flashin'
in the hot new jersey night
 meanwhile, far away in another part of town
rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
 when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
just like the time before, and the time before that
in paterson that's just the way things go
if you're black, you might as well
not show up on the street
'less you wanna draw the heat
 alfred bello had a partner
and he had a rap for the cops
him and arthur dexter bradley
were just out prowlin' around
he said, i saw two men runnin' out
they looked like middleweights
they jumped into a white car
with out of state plates
 and miss patty valentine just nodded her head
cop said: wait a minute, boys
this one's not dead
so they took him to the infirmary
and though this man could hardly see
they told him that
he could identify the guilty men
 four in the mornin' and they haul rubin in
take him to the hospital
and they bring him upstairs
the wounded man looks up
through his one dyin' eye
says: why'd you bring him in here for?
he ain't the guy!
 yes, here's the story of the hurricane
the man the authorities came to blame
for somethin' that he never done
put in a prison cell
but one time he could'a been
the champion of the world
 four months later, the ghettos are in flame
rubin's in south america
fightin' for his name
while arthur dexter bradley is
still in the robbery game
and the cops are puttin' the screws to him
lookin' for somebody to blame
 remember that murder that happened in a bar?
remember you said you saw the getaway car?
you think you'd like to play ball with the law?
think it might'a been that fighter
that you saw runnin' that night?
don't forget that you are white
 arthur dexter bradley said: i'm really not sure
cops said: a poor boy like you could use a break
we got you for the motel job
and we're talkin' to your friend bello
now you don't want to have to go back to jail
be a nice fellow
 you'll be doin' society a favor
that son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
we want to put his ass in stir
we want to pin this triple murder on him
he ain't no gentleman jim
 rubin could take a man out with just one punch
but he never did like to talk about it all that much
it's my work, he'd say, and i do it for pay
and when it's over i'd just as soon go on my way
 up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail
but then they took him to the jail house
where they try to turn a man into a mouse
 all of rubin's cards were marked in advance
the trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
the judge made rubin's witnesses
drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched
he was a revolutionary bum
 and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger
and though they could not produce the gun
the d.a. said he was the one who did the deed
and the all-white jury agreed
 rubin carter was falsely tried
the crime was murder one, guess who testified?
bello and bradley and they both baldly lied
and the newspapers
they all went along for the ride
 how can the life of such a man
be in the palm of some fool's hand?
to see him obviously framed
couldn't help, but make me feel ashamed
to live in a land
where justice is a game
 now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
while rubin sits like buddha in a ten-foot cell
an innocent man in a living hell
 that's the story of the hurricane
but it won't be over till they clear his name
and give him back the time he's done
put in a prison cell

you gotta have a real need
you gotta sleep on your toes
and when you're on the street
you got to be able to pick out the easy meat
with your eyes closed
 and then moving in silently
down wind and out of sight
you got to strike when the moment is right
without thinking
 and after a while
you can work on points for style
like the club tie
and the firm handshake
a certain look in the eye and an easy smile
 you have to be trusted
by the people that you lie to
so that when they turn their backs on you
you'll get the chance to put the knife in
 you gotta keep one eye
looking over your shoulder
you know, it's going to get harder
and harder and harder
as you get older
 yeah, and in the end, you'll pack up
and fly down south
hide your head in the sand
just another sad old man
all alone and dying of cancer
 and when you lose control
you'll reap the harvest you have sown
and as the fear grows
the bad blood slows and turns to stone
 and it's too late to lose the weight
you used to need to throw around
so have a good drown, as you go down all alone
dragged down by the stone
 stone, stone, stone, stone
 got to admit
that i'm a little bit confused
sometimes it seems to me
as if i'm just being used
 gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off
this creeping malaise
if i don't stand my own ground
how can i find my way out of this maze?
 deaf, dumb and blind
you just keep on pretending
that everyone's expendable
and no one has a real friend
 and it seems to you, the thing to do
would be to isolate the winner

to change the man he seems
and the poet sheaths his pen
while the soldier lifts his sword
and the oldest of the family
is moving with authority
coming from across the sea
he challenges the son
who puts him to the run
 what do you do when the old man's gone?
do you want to be him?
and your real self sings the song
do you want to free him?
no one to help you get up steam
and the whirlpool turns you way off beam
 i've come down from the upper class
to mend your rotten ways
my father was a man of power
whom everyone obeyed
 so come on all you criminals!
i've got to put you straight
just like i did with my old man
twenty years too late
your bread and water's going cold
your hair is short and neat
i'll judge you all and make damn sure
that no one judges me
 you curl your toes in fun
as you smile at everyone
you meet the stares
you're unaware
that your doings aren't done
and you laugh most ruthlessly
as you tell us what not to be
but how are we supposed to see
where we should run?
 i see you shuffle in the courtroom
with your rings upon your fingers
and your downy little sidies
and your silver-buckle shoes
playing at the hard case
you follow the example of the comic-paper idol
who lets you bend the rules
 so, come on you childhood heroes
won't you rise up from the pages
of your comic-books, you super crooks
and show us all the way?
well, make your will and testament
won't you join your local government?
we'll have superman for president
let robin save the day
you put your bet on number one
and it comes up every time
the other kids have all backed down
and they put you first in line
and so you finally ask yourself
just how big you are
and you take your place in a wiser world
of bigger motor cars
 (and you wonder who to call on)
 so, where the hell was biggles
when you needed him last saturday?
and where are all the sportsmen
who always pulled you through?
they're all resting down in cornwall
writing up their memoirs
for a paperback edition of the boy scout manual
 see there, a man is born
and we pronounce him fit for peace
there's a load lifted from his shoulders
with the discovery of his disease
we'll take the child from him, put it to the test
teach it to be a wise man, how to fool the rest
 we will be gearing toward the average
rather than the exceptional
god's an overwhelming responsibility
we walked through the maternity ward
and saw 218 babies wearing nylons
it says here that cats
are on the upgrade, upgrade?
 in the clear white circles of morning wonder
i take my place with the lord of the hills
and the blue-eyed soldiers
stand slightly discolored
in neat little rows
sporting canvas frillswith their jock-straps pinching
they slouch to attention
whilst queuing for sarnies
at the office canteen
singing, how's your grannie? 
and good old ernie
he coughed up a tenner
on a premium bond win
 the legends worded in the ancient tribal hymn
lie cradled in the seagull's call
and all the promises they made
are ground beneath the sadist's fall
 the poet and the wise man stand behind the gun
and signal for the crack of dawn, light the sun
do you believe in the day?
 the dawn creation of the kings has begun
soft venus lonely maiden
brings the ageless one
do you believe in the day?
 the fading hero has returned to the night
and fully pregnant with the day
wise men endorse the poet's sight
do you believe in the day?
do you? believe in the day!
 let me tell you the tales of your life
of your love and the cut of the knife
the tireless oppression the wisdom instilled
the desire to kill or be killed
let me sing of the losers who lie
in the street as the last bus goes by
the pavements are empty
the gutters run red
while the fool toasts his god in the sky
 so, come all ye young men
who are building castles
kindly state the time of the year
and join your voices in a hellish chorus
mark the precise nature of your fear
 let me help you to pick up your dead
as the sins of the father are fed
with the blood of the fools
and the thoughts of the wise
and from the pan under your bed
let me make you a present of song
as the wise man breaks wind and is gone
while the fool with the hour-glass
is cooking his goose
and the nursery rhyme winds along
 so, come all ye young men
who are building castles
kindly state the time of the year
and join your voices in a hellish chorus
mark the precise nature of your fear
see, the summer lightning
casts its bolts upon you
and the hour of judgement draweth near
would you be the fool stood in the suit of armour
or the wiser man who rushes clear?
 so, come on you childhood heroes
won't you rise up from the pages
of your comic-books, your super-crooks
and show us all the way?
well, make your will and testament
won't you join your local government?
we'll have superman for president
let robin save the day

when you needed him last saturday?
and where are all the sportsmen

they're all resting down in cornwall

for a paperback edition of the boy scout manual
 of course
so you ride yourselves over the fields
and you make all your animal deals
and your wise men don't know how it feels
to be thick as a brick",4.0,0.4049122807017544,5.689999999999923,1.3711798,3.133711903027615,1425,1.14,0.125057505750575,1

 if i could get another chance
another walk
another dance with him

to get my way i would run
from her to him
he'd make me laugh just to comfort me

just what my mama said
later that night when i was asleep
he left a dollar under my sheet
never dreamed that he
would be gone from me

one final step
one final dance with him

dance with my father again

let me drop some shit like this here real smooth
 [scarface]
at night i can't sleep, i toss and turn
candle sticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
four walls just staring at a nigga
i'm paranoid, sleeping with my finger on the trigga
my momma's always stressing i ain't living right
but i ain't going out without a fight
see, everytime my eyes close
i start sweatin, and blood starts comin out my nose
it's somebody watchin' the ak'
but i don't know who it is, so i'm watchin my back
i can see him when i'm deep in the covers
when i awake i don't see the motherfucker
he owns a black hat like i own
a black suit and a cane like my own
some might say ""take a chill, g""
but fuck that shit, there's a nigga trying to kill me
i'm poppin' in a clip when the wind blows
every twenty seconds got me peeping out my window
investigating the joint for traps
checking my telephone for taps
i'm staring at the woman on the corner
it's fucked up when your mind is playing tricks on you
 [willie d]
i make big money, i drive big cars
everybody know me, it's like i'm a movie star
but late at night, somethin ain't right
i feel i'm being tailed by the same sucker's head lights
is it that fool that i ran off the block
or is it that nigga last week that i shot
or is it the one i beat for five thousand dollars
thought he had 'caine but it was gold medal flour
reach under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
ain't no use to be lying, i was scareder than a motherfucker
hooked a left into popeye's and beared down quick
if it's going down let's get this shit over with
here they come, just like i figured
i got my hand on the motherfucking trigger
what i saw'll make your ass start giggling
three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
i live by the sword
i take my boys everywhere i go
because i'm paranoid
i keep looking over my shoulder and peeping around corners
my mind is playing tricks on me
 [scarface]
day by day it's more impossible to cope
i feel like i'm the one that's doing dope
can't keep a steady hand because i'm nervous
every sunday morning i'm in service
praying for forgiveness
and trying to find an exit out of the business
i know the lord is looking at me
but yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
i often drift when i drive
havin fatal thoughts of suicide
bang and get it over with
and then i'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
i got a little boy to look after
and if i died then my child would be a bastard
i had a woman down with me
but to me it seemed like she was down to get me
she helped me out in this shit
but to me she was just another bitch
now she's back with her mother
now i'm realizing that i love her
now i'm feeling lonely

this year halloween fell on a weekend
me and geto boyz are trick-or-treating
robbing little kids for bags
till a law man got behind our ass
so we speeded up the pace
took a look back and he was right before our face
he'd be in for a squable no doubt
so i swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
he was going down, we figga'd
but this wasn't no ordinary nigga
he stood about six or seven feet
now, that's the nigga i'd been seeing in my sleep
so we triple-teamed on him
dropping them motherfuckin beads on him
the more i swung the more blood flew
then he disappeared and my boys disappeared, too
then i felt just like a fiend
it wasn't even close to halloween
it was dark as fuck on the streets
my hands were all bloody from punching on the concrete

a mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
sometimes i think i'm going insane, i swear i might hijack a plane
 don't push me 'cause i'm close to the edge
i'm trying not to lose my head
it's like a jungle sometimes
it makes me wonder how i keep from going under
it's like a jungle sometimes
it makes me wonder how i keep from going under
 my son said, daddy, i don't wanna go to school
'cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think i'm a fool
and all the kids smoke reefer, i think it'd be cheaper
if i just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
 'cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
you got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
they pushed that girl in front of the train
took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
stabbed that man right in his heart
gave him a transplant for a brand new start
 i can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
i feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
hear them say, you want some more? ' livin' on a see-saw
 don't push me 'cause i'm close to the edge
i'm trying not to lose my head (say what?)

it makes me wonder how i keep from goin' under

 a child is born with no state of mind
blind to the ways of mankind
god is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
because only god knows what you'll go through
you'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate
and your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
the places you play and where you stay
 looks like one great big alleyway
you'll admire all the number-book takers
thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
and you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
 you say, i'm cool, huh, i'm no fool
but then you wind up droppin' out of high school
now you're unemployed, all null and void
walking 'round like you're pretty boy floyd
turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
got sent up for a eight-year bid
 now your manhood is took and you're a maytag
spend the next two years as a undercover fag
being used and abused to serve like hell
till one day you was found hung dead in the cell
 it was plain to see that your life was lost
you was cold and your body swung back and forth
but now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
of how you lived so fast and died so young, so
 don't push me cause i'm close to the edge
i'm trying not to lose my head
ah, huh, huh, huh, huh

it makes me wonder how i keep from going under

 you used to captivate me
by your resonating light
now, i'm bound by the life you've left behind
your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

maybe together we can get somewhere
 any place is better
starting from zero, got nothing to lose
maybe we'll make something
me, myself, i got nothing to prove
 you got a fast car
i got a plan to get us outta here
i been working at the convenience store
managed to save just a little bit of money
 won't have to drive too far
just 'cross the border and into the city
you and i can both get jobs
finally see what it means to be living
 see, my old man's got a problem
he lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
he says his body's too old for working
his body's too young to look like his
 when momma went off and left him
she wanted more from life than he could give
i said: somebody's gotta take care of him
so i quit school and that's what i did
 you got a fast car
is it fast enough so we can fly away?
we gotta make a decision
leave tonight, or live and die this way
 so i remember when we were driving
driving in your car
speed so fast it felt like i was drunk
city lights lay out before us
and your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
and i, i had a feeling that i belonged
i, i had a feeling i could be someone
be someone, be someone
 you got a fast car
we go cruising, entertain ourselves
you still ain't got a job
and i work in a market as a checkout girl
 i know things will get better
you'll find work and i'll get promoted
we'll move out of the shelter
buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

i got a job that pays all our bills
you stay out drinkin' late at the bar

i'll choose work over bitches, i'll make schools out of prison
i'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service

i used to love without fear a long time ago
and all i ever wanted was love
then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
try to make me feel like i was unworthy
took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
truth was they never did deserve me no!
 i had to lose myself so i could love you better
i had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
love you better, lose myself in love
and that's just the way it is?
 couldn't tell me i was in love when i needed it
when, all i ever wanted was love.
should a told me i was worth receiving it
but all i ever wanted was love
there's something awkward about the selflessness it
takes to
give love and the good that it makes you!
true love can never really forsake you
but it took a little while just for me to see!
 i had to lose myself so i could love you better
i had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
make it better
had to lose myself, had to lose myself
so i could love you better

and i couldn't love you perfectly with that fear in my head
so i perilously had to face the danger
so i could come back and love you whole instead

 it's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
the one you let hit it and never called you again
'member when he told you he was 'bout the benjamins?
you act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
to begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
like you wasn't down and you called him again?
plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
if you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
talking out your neck, sayin' you're a christian
a muslim, sleeping with the jinn
now that was the sin that did jezebel in
who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
you know i only say it 'cause i'm truly genuine
don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
baby girl, respect is just a minimum
niggas fucked up and you still defendin' 'em
now, lauryn is only human
don't think i haven't been through the same predicament
let it sit inside your head like a million women in philly, penn
it's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
look at where you be in, hair weaves like europeans
fake nails done by koreans

 guys, you know you'd better watch out
some girls, some girls are only about
that thing, that thing, that thing
that thing, that thing, that thing
 the second verse is dedicated to the men
more concerned with his rims and his timbs than his women
him and his men come in the club like hooligans
don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
crystal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
the pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
need to take care of they three or four kids
and they face a court case when the child support late
money taking and heartbreakin', now you wonder why women hate men
the sneaky, silent men
the punk, domestic violence men
quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
how you gonna win when you ain't right within?
how you gonna win when you ain't right within?

(no! no, no, i don’t think so)
i say it for me, uh, i'm an adult i say, wait
you’re too young to be in love, this is silly
you’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
you wear fancy adidas
i mean, it might be something i don’t know
(it's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
well, you tell me. what’s the difference?

i met up with a gambler
we were both too tired to sleep
so we took turns a-starin'
out the window at the darkness
till boredom overtook us
he began to speak
 he said: son, i've made a life
out of readin' people's faces
knowin' what the cards were
by the way they held their eyes
so if you don't mind my sayin'
i can see you're out of aces
for a taste of your whiskey
i'll give you some advice
 so i handed him my bottle
and he drank down my last swallow
then he bummed a cigarette
and asked me for a light
and the night got deathly quiet
and his face lost all expression
said: if
you're gonna play the game, boy
you gotta learn to play it right
 you've got to know
when to hold 'em
know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away
know when to run
you never count your money

there'll be time enough for countin'

the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away
and knowin' what to keep
'cause every hand's a winner
and every hand's a loser
and the best that you can hope for
is to die in your sleep
 and when he finished speakin'
he turned back toward the window
crushed out his cigarette
and faded off to sleep
