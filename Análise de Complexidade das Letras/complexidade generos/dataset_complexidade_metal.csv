narrow streets of cobblestone
'neath the halo of a street lamp

by the flash of a neon light
that split the night
and touched the sound of silence
 and in the naked light i saw
ten thousand people, maybe more
people talking without speaking
people hearing without listening
 people writing songs
that voices never share
and no one dare
disturb the sound of silence

silence like a cancer grows
hear my words that i might teach you
take my arms that i might reach you

and echoed in the wells of silence

 fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
the scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores
on the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as we go
in fire and pain, and once again we know
 so now we fly ever free
we're free before the thunderstorm
on towards the wilderness our quest carries on
far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
deep inside our hearts and all our souls
 so far away we wait for the day
for the lives all so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
through the fire and the flames we carry on
 as the red day is dawning
and the lightning cracks the sky
they'll raise their hands to the heavens above
with resentment in their eyes
running back from the mid-morning light
there's a burning in my heart
we're banished from a time in a fallen land
to a life beyond the stars
 in your darkest dreams see to believe
our destiny is time
and endlessly we'll all be free tonight
 and on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
all alone in desperation, now the time has gone
lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
day after day this misery must go on
 so far away we wait for the day
for the lives all so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
through the fire and the flames we carry on
 woah
 now here we stand with their blood on our hands
we fought so hard now can we understand
i'll break the seal of this curse if i possibly can
for freedom of every man
 so far away we wait for the day
for the lives all so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days

about a thing that i saw
one night wandering in the everglades
i'd one drink, but no more
 i was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
gazing up at the stars
not aware of a presence so near to me
watching my every move
 feeling scared and i fell to my knees
as something rushed me from the trees
took me to an unholy place
and that is where i fell from grace
 then they summoned me over to join in with them
to the dance of the dead
into the circle of fire, i followed them
into the middle i was led
 as if time had stopped still
i was numb with fear, but still
i wanted to go
and the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
as i walked onto the coals
 and i felt i was in a trance
and my spirit was lifted from me
and if only someone had the chance
to witness what happened to me
 and i danced, and i pranced
and i sang with them
all had death in their eyes
lifeless figures
they were undead, all of them
they had ascended from hell
 as i danced with the dead
my free spirit was laughing
and howling down at me
below my undead body
just danced the circle of dead
 until the time came to reunite us both
my spirit came back down to me
i didn't know if i was alive or dead
as the others all joined in with me
 by luck then a skirmish started
and took the attention away from me
when they took their gaze from me
was the moment that i fled
 i ran like hell, faster than the wind
but behind i did not glance
one thing that i did not dare
was to look just straight ahead
 when you know that your time has come around
you know you'll be prepared for it
say your last goodbyes to everyone
have a drink and say a prayer for it
 when you're lying in your sleep
when you're lying in your bed
and you wake from your dreams
to go dancing with the dead
 when you're lying in your sleep
when you're lying in your bed
and you wake from your dreams
to go dancing with the dead
 to this day i guess i'll never know
just why they let me go
but i'll never go dancing no more
