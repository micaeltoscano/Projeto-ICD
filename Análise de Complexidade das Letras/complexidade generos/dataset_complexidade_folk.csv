you can hear the boats go by
you can spend the night beside her
and you know that she's half crazy
but that's why you want to be there
and she feeds you tea and oranges
that come all the way from china
and just when you mean to tell her
that you have no love to give her
then she gets you on her wavelength
and she lets the river answer
that you've always been her lover
and you want to travel with her
and you want to travel blind
and you know that she will trust you
for you've touched her perfect body
with your mind
 and jesus was a sailor
when he walked upon the water
and he spent a long time watching
from his lonely wooden tower
and when he knew for certain
only drowning men could see him
he said ""all men will be sailors then
until the sea shall free them""
but he himself was broken
long before the sky would open
forsaken, almost human
he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
and you want to travel with him
and you want to travel blind
and you think maybe you'll trust him
for he's touched your perfect body
with his mind
 now suzanne takes your hand
and she leads you to the river
she is wearing rags and feathers
from salvation army counters
and the sun pours down like honey
on our lady of the harbour
and she shows you where to look
among the garbage and the flowers
there are heroes in the seaweed
there are children in the morning
they are leaning out for love
and they will lean that way forever
while suzanne holds the mirror
and you want to travel with her
and you want to travel blind

an' went to detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
the first year they had me puttin' wheels on cadillacs
 every day i'd watch them beauties roll by
and sometimes i'd hang my head and cry
'cause i always wanted me one that was long and black.
 one day i devised myself a plan
that should be the envy of most any man
i'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
but i figured i'd have it all by the time i retired
i'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand.
 i'd get it one piece at a time
and it wouldn't cost me a dime
you'll know it's me when i come through your town
i'm gonna ride around in style
i'm gonna drive everybody wild
'cause i'll have the only one there is a round.
 so the very next day when i punched in
with my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
i left that day with a lunch box full of gears
now, i never considered myself a thief
gm wouldn't miss just one little piece
especially if i strung it out over several years.
 the first day i got me a fuel pump
and the next day i got me an engine and a trunk
then i got me a transmission and all of the chrome
the little things i could get in my big lunchbox
like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
but the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home.
 now, up to now my plan went all right
'til we tried to put it all together one night
and that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong.
 the transmission was a '53
and the motor turned out to be a '73
and when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone.
 so we drilled it out so that it would fit
and with a little bit of help with an a-daptor kit
we had that engine runnin' just like a song
now the headlight' was another sight
we had two on the left and one on the right
but when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on.
 the back end looked kinda funny too
but we put it together and when we got thru
well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
about that time my wife walked out
and i could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
but she opened the door and said, ""honey, take me for a spin.""
 so we drove up town just to get the tags
and i headed her right on down main drag
i could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
but up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'cause to type it up it took the whole staff
and when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds.
 i got it one piece at a time
and it didn't cost me a dime
you'll know it's me when i come through your town
i'm gonna ride around in style
i'm gonna drive everybody wild

i was laying in bed
wondering if she'd changed at all
if her hair was still red
 her folks they said our lives together
sure was going to be rough
they never did like mama's homemade dress
papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
 and i was standing on the side of the road
rain falling on my shoes
heading out for the east coast
lord knows i've paid some dues
getting through
tangled up in blue
 she was married when we first met
soon to be divorced
i helped her out of a jam, i guess
but i used a little too much force
 we drove that car as far as we could
abandoned it out west
split up on a dark sad night
both agreeing it was best
 she turned around to look at me
as i was walking away
i heard her say over my shoulder
we'll meet again someday on the avenue
tangled up in blue
 i had a job in the great north woods
working as a cook for a spell
but i never did like it all that much
and one day the ax just fell
 so i drifted down to new orleans
where i lucky was to be employed
working for a while on a fishing boat
right outside of delacroix
 but all the while i was alone
the past was close behind
i've seen a lot of women
but she never escaped my mind
and i just grew
tangled up in blue
 she was working in a topless place
and i stopped in for a beer
i just kept looking at the side of her face
in the spotlight, so clear
 and later on, when the crowd thinned out
i was just about to do the same
she was standing there, in the back of my chair
said to me: tell me, don't i know your name?
 i muttered something underneath my breath
she studied the lines on my face
i must admit, i felt a little uneasy
when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
tangled up in blue
 she lit a burner on the stove
and offered me a pipe
i thought you'd never say hello, she said
you look like the silent type
 then she opened up a book of poems
and handed it to me
written by an italian poet
from the thirteenth century
 and every one of them words rang true
and glowed like burning coal
pouring off of every page
like it was written in my soul from me to you
tangled up in blue
 i lived with them on montague street
in a basement down the stairs
there was music in the cafés at night
and revolution in the air
 then he started into dealing with slaves
and something inside of him died
she had to sell everything she owned
and froze up inside
 and when it finally, the bottom fell out
i became withdrawn
the only thing i knew how to do was to keep on keeping on
like a bird that flew
tangled up in blue
 so now i'm going back again
i got to get to her somehow
all the people we used to know
they're an illusion to me now
 some are mathematicians
some are carpenter's wives
don't know how it all got started
i don't know what they're doing with their lives
 but me, i'm still on the road
a-heading for another joint
we always did feel the same
we just saw it from a different point of view

i was playing a show in miami in the theater of divine comedy.
told about jesus, told about the rain,
she told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
by a man who danced on the roof of the embassy. 
 was she a child or a woman, i can't say which
from one to another she could to easily switch
we went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach.
could i been used and played as a pawn?
it certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech.

 she looked into my soul through the clothes that i wore
she said, ""we got a mutual friend over by the door,
and you know he's got our best interest in mind.""
he was well connected but her heart was a snare
and she had left him to die in there,
there were payments due and he was a little behind.
 the cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
street band playing ""nearer my god to thee.""
we met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,
she said, ""i know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
you can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.""

i can still remember
how that music used to make me smile
and i knew if i had my chance
that i could make those people dance
and maybe they'd be happy for a while
 but february made me shiver
with every paper i'd deliver
bad news on the doorstep
i couldn't take one more step
 i can't remember if i cried
when i read about his widowed bride
but something touched me deep inside
the day the music died
 so bye bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
and them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
singin': this'll be the day that i die
this'll be the day that i die
 did you write the book of love
and do you have faith in god above
if the bible tells you so?
now do you believe in rock'n roll?
can music save your mortal soul?
and can you teach me how to dance real slow?
 well, i know that you're in love with him
'cause i saw you dancin' in the gym
you both kicked off your shoes
man, i dig those rhythm and blues
 i was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
with a pink carnation and a pickup truck
but i knew i was out of luck
the day the music died
 i started singin': bye bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
and singin': this’ll be the day that i die
this’ll be the day that i die
 now, for ten years we've been on our own
and moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
but that's not how it used to be
when the jester sang for the king and queen
in a coat he borrowed from james dean
and a voice that came from you and me
 oh, and while the king was looking down
the jester stole his thorny crown
the courtroom was adjourned
no verdict was returned
 and while lennon read a book on marx
the quartet practiced in the park
and we sang dirges in the dark
the day the music died
 we were singin': bye bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye
and singin': this'll be the day that i die
this'll be the day that i die
 helter skelter in a summer swelter
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
eight miles high and fallin' fast
it landed foul on the grass
the players tried for a forward pass
with the jester on the sidelines in a cast
 now, the half-time air was sweet perfume
while the sergeants played a marching tune
we all got up to dance
oh, but we never got the chance
'cause the players tried to take the field
the marching band refused to yield
do you recall what was revealed
the day the music died?
 we started singin': bye bye, miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye
and singin': this'll be the day that i die
this'll be the day that i die
 oh, and there we were, all in one place
a generation lost in space
with no time left to start again
so come on, jack be nimble, jack be quick
jack flash sat on a candlestick
'cause fire is the devil’s only friend
 oh, and as i watched him on the stage
my hands were clenched in fists of rage
no angel born in hell
could break that satan's spell
and as the flames climbed high into the night
to light the sacrificial rite
i saw satan laughing with delight
the day the music died
 we were singin': bye bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye
and singin': this'll be the day that i die
this'll be the day that i die
 i met a girl who sang the blues
and i asked her for some happy news
but she just smiled and turned away
i went down to the sacred store
where i'd heard the music years before
but the man there said the music wouldn't play
and in the streets, the children screamed
the lovers cried and the poets dreamed
but not a word was spoken
the church bells all were broken
and the three men i admire most
the father, son, and the holy ghost
they caught the last train for the coast
the day the music died
 and they were singin': bye bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
and them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye
singin': this'll be the day that i die

i didn't do it, he says
and he throws up his hands
i was only robbin' the register

 i saw them leavin', he says, and he stops
one of us had better call up the cops

 meanwhile, far away in another part of town
rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

take him to the hospital

lookin' for somebody to blame

remember you said you saw the getaway car?

 how can the life of such a man

to see him obviously framed
couldn't help, but make me feel ashamed

 shadows on the hills
sketch the trees and the daffodils
catch the breeze and the winter chills

and how you tried to set them free

perhaps they'll listen now

swirling clouds in violet haze
reflect in vincent's eyes of china blue
 colors changing hue
morning fields of amber grain
weathered faces lined in pain
are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
 now i understand
what you tried to say to me
and how you suffered for your sanity
and how you tried to set them free
 they would not listen, they did not know how
perhaps they'll listen now
 for they could not love you
but still your love was true
and when no hope was left in sight
on that starry, starry night
 you took your life, as lovers often do
but i could've told you vincent
this world was never meant for
one as beautiful as you
 starry, starry night
portraits hung in empty halls
frame-less heads on nameless walls
with eyes that watch the world and can't forget
 like the strangers that you've met
the ragged men in ragged clothes
the silver thorn of bloody rose
lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

dawning pretty laces
weaving capes of gold
 and framing muffled faces

their kisses open up ravines
 fences frozen in a dance
they've yet to perform
