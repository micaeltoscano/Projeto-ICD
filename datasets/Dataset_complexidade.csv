That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
 Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
 Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
 Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
 You say I took the Name in vain
I don't even know the Name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
 Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
 I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Caught in a landslide

Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low

 Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on

Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time

I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth

About a lucky man who made the grave

Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke, and I went into a dream

I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
 Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
 And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue
 She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
 We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
 She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
We'll meet again someday on the avenue
Tangled up in blue
 I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
 So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
 But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I've seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue
 She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
 And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, in the back of my chair
Said to me: Tell me, don't I know your name?
 I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
 She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
I thought you'd never say hello, she said
You look like the silent type
 Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
 And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue
 I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafés at night
And revolution in the air
 Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
 And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
 So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
 Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
 But me, I'm still on the road
A-heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view

I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for long long years
Stole many a man's soul and faith
 And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had His moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
 Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
 I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
 I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank
 Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
 I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
 I shouted out
Who killed the Kennedys?
When after all
It was you and me
 Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay
 Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
 Get down, baby
 Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game
 Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
 So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
 Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
 Get down
 Tell me, baby, what's my name
Tell me, honey, can ya guess my name
Tell me, baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame
 What's my name

They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As lady and I look out tonight
From desolation row
 Cinderella, she seems so easy
It takes one to know one -, she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning
You belong to me I believe
And someone says: You're in the wrong place, my friend
You better leave
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row
 Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortunetelling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the good samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On desolation row
 Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
 To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into desolation row
 Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
He looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row
 Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
Have mercy on his soul
They all play on penny whistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From desolation row
 Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
They're spoonfeeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
 And the phantom's shouting to skinny girls
Get outa here if you don't know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row
 Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row
 Praise be to nero's neptune
The titanic sails at dawn
And everybody's shouting
Which side are you on?
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row
 Yes, I received your letter yesterday
(About the time the door knob broke)
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you mail them

Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, My God, they've killed them all!
 Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been
The champion of the world
 Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello
Movin' around mysteriously
I didn't do it, he says
And he throws up his hands
I was only robbin' the register
I hope you understand
 I saw them leavin', he says, and he stops
One of us had better call up the cops
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
 Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
 When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before, and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black, you might as well
Not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat
 Alfred Bello had a partner
And he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley
Were just out prowlin' around
He said, I saw two men runnin' out
They looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car
With out of state plates
 And miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said: Wait a minute, boys
This one's not dead
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that
He could identify the guilty men
 Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital
And they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up
Through his one dyin' eye
Says: Why'd you bring him in here for?
He ain't the guy!
 Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been
The champion of the world
 Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America
Fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley is
Still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame
 Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
You think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Think it might'a been that fighter
That you saw runnin' that night?
Don't forget that you are white
 Arthur Dexter Bradley said: I'm really not sure
Cops said: A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
And we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't want to have to go back to jail
Be a nice fellow
 You'll be doin' society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim
 Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
 Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
 All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses
Drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
He was a revolutionary bum
 And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
 Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers
They all went along for the ride
 How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help, but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land
Where justice is a game
 Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the Sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
 That's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done

Rolling the dice, not always a winner.

 Under pressure but not bent out of shape

Greedy with my children, my lovers and my wife.
Greedy for the good things as well as the bad.

Racing around to come up behind you again

Shorter of breath

Or half a page of scribbled lines (oh, oh)

And the meek shall inherit the earth
 [II. Temples of Syrinx]
We've taken care of everything
The words you hear the songs you sing
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes
 It's one for all and all for one
We work together common sons
Never need to wonder how or why
 We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers
Fill the hallowed halls
We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life
Are held within our walls
 Look around this world we made
Equality our stock in trade
Come and join the Brotherhood of Man
Oh what a nice contented world!
Let the banners be unfurled
Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand
 We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers
Fill the hallowed halls
We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life
Are held within our walls
 [III. Discovery]
What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate and give music
What can this thing be that I found?
 See how it sings like a sad heart
And joyously screams out its pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain
Or notes that fall gently like rain
 I can't wait to share this new wonder
The people will all see its light
Let them all make their own music
The Priests praise my name on this night
 [IV. Presentation]
I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle
I thought that you should know
 Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you
 Yes, we know it's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways
The world is doing fine
 Another toy that helped destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan
 I can't believe you're saying
These things just can't be true
Our world could use this beauty
Just think what we might do
 Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you
 Don't annoy us further
We have our work to do
Just think about the average
What use have they for you?
 Another toy that helped destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan
 [V. Oracle: The Dream]
I wandered home though the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream can't you show me the light?
 I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days
 I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes
 They left the planet long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home, to tear the Temples down
Home, to change
 [VI. Soliloquy]
The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams
 Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
Oh, no
 My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood spills over

In geometric order
An insulated border
In between the bright lights
And the far unlit unknown
 Growing up it all seems so one-sided
Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided
Detached and subdivided
In the mass production zone
 Nowhere is the dreamer
Or the misfit so alone
 Subdivisions
In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
Subdivisions
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out
Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth
 Drawn like moths we drift into the city
The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action
Lit up like a firefly
Just to feel the living night
 Some will sell their dreams for small desires
Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps
And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight

All the redemption I can offer, girl
Is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
 Except roll down the window
And let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open
These two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back
Heaven's waiting on down the tracks
 Oh-oh, come take my hand
Riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh-oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the Sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh, Thunder Road, sit tight
Take hold, Thunder Road
 Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back, if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open, but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
Tonight we'll be free
All the promises'll be broken
 There were ghosts in the eyes
Of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
 And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines roaring on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So, Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers
And I'm pulling out of here to win",0.0,0.5579710144927537,1.9700000000000013,3.0474799,2.0373292890849077,414,1.0,1

I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
 But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
 I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
 So bye bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin': This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
 Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock'n roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
 Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
 I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
 I started singin': Bye bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin': This’ll be the day that I die
This’ll be the day that I die
 Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
 Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
 And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
 We were singin': Bye bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye
And singin': This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
 Helter Skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
 Now, the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
 We started singin': Bye bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye
And singin': This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
 Oh, and there we were, all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil’s only friend
 Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
 We were singin': Bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye
And singin': This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
 I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
 And they were singin': Bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye
Singin': This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Of the big lake they called 'Gitche Gumee'
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty.
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early.
 The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
 The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'.
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the Gales of November came slashin'.
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind.
 When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'.
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya.
At Seven P.M. a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good t'know ya
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril.
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.
 Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searches all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her.
They might have split up or they might have capsized;
May have broke deep and took water.
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters.
 Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion.
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams;
The islands and bays are for sportsmen.
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her,
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the Gales of November remembered.
 In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,
In the Maritime Sailors' Cathedral.
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald.
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call 'Gitche Gumee'.

And now go and get her

To make it better

 Don't you know to that is just you
Hey Jude you'll do

Take a sad song
And make it better
 Remember
To let her under your skin

And a lorry load of volunteers approached the border town
There were men from dublin and from cork, fermanagh and tyrone
But the leader was a limerick man sean south of garryowen
And as they moved along the street up to the barracks door
They scorned the danger the would meet the fate that lay in store
They were fighting for old ireland to make their very own
And the foremost of this gallant band was south of garryowen
But the seargant spoiled their daring plans he spied them through the door
And with sten guns and with rifle a hail of death did pour
But before that awful night was past two men lay cold as stone
There was one from near the border and one from garryowen
No more he'll hear the seagull cry o'er the murmuring shannon tide
For he fell beneath a northern sky brave o'hanlon by his side

I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
 Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
 You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
 Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living
 See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
 When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said: Somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
 You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way
 So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
 You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
 I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
 So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone

I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar

I'm known from the Liffey, down to Segue
I'm known by the name of old Johnny Dhu
Of all the trades that's goin sure beggin' is the best
For when a man is tired he can sit down and rest
Beg for his dinner he has nothin' else to do
Only cut around the corner with his old rigadoo
 I slept in a barn way down at Currabawn
A wet night came on and I slept until the dawn
With holes in the roof and the rain coming through
The rats and the cats they were playing peekaboo
When who should awaken but the woman of the house
With her white spotty apron and her calico blouse
She began to frighten and I said ""Boo!
Arrah don't be afraid ma'am, it's only Johnny Dhu""
 I met a little flaxy-haired girl one day
""Good morning, little flaxy-haired girl"", I did say
""Good morning, little beggarman, a-how do you do
With your rags and your bags and your old rigadoo?""
""I'll buy a pair of leggings, a collar and a tie
And a nice young lady I'll fetch bye and bye
I'll buy a pair of goggles and colour them blue
And and old-fashioned lady, I will make her too""

Over the fields with my great heavy sack
With holes in my shoes and my toes peeping through

Drawing me in and you kicking me out
Got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
 What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright
 My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
 'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
 Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
 How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you
 My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
 'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
 Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
Give me all of you, oh
 Cards on the table
We're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard
 'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
 Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
