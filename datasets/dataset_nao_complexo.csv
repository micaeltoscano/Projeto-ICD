Down a Boreen green came a sweet coleen and she smiled as she passed me by
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet to the sheen of her nut-brown hair
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself, for to see I was really there
 From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and from Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the brown coleen that I met in the County Down
 As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head and I looked with a feeling rare
And I says, says I, to a passer-by: Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?
He smiled at me and he says, says he: That's the gem of Irelands crown
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann she's the star of the County Down
 From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and from Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the brown coleen that I met in the County Down
At the harvest fair she'll be surely there, so I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right, for a smile from my nut-brown rose
 No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke, til my plough is a rust-coloured brown
Til a smiling bride by my own fireside, sits the star of the County Down
 From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and from Galway to Dublin town
No maid I've seen like the brown coleen that I met in the County Down
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and from Galway to Dublin town

Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
 Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well now they know
 Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
 It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all
 It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free!
 Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on
 My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
 Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl has gone
Here I stand
In the light of day
Let the storm rage on

Six feet under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing?

Still a chance for you?

Cannot be replaced

What the future holds
After a hurricane
Comes a rainbow
 Maybe a reason why
All the doors are closed
So you could open one
That leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt
Your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
 You just gotta ignite the light

 Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
 But now I
Look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
 And when I hurt
Hurting runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holding you?
 Warm, touching warm
Reaching out
Touching me
Touching you
 Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
No, no, no
 Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
Sweet Caroline
I believe it never could

I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
 Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
 You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
 Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living
 See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
 When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said: Somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
 You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way
 So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
 You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
 I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
 So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
 You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
 I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together, you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
 You got a fast car

It's true love we're making
Something to last for all time
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life
Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you
