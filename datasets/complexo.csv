Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
 Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me
To me
 Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
 Mama! Ooh!
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters
 Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth
 Mama! Ooh!
(Anyway the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
 I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche! Scaramouche!
Will you do the fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me!
Galileo! Galileo!
Galileo! Galileo!
Galileo, Figaro!
Magnifico!
 I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
(He's just a poor boy from a poor family)
(Spare him his life, from this monstrosity)
 Easy come, easy go
Will you let me go?
 Bismillah!
No, we will not let you go!
(Let him go!)
Bismillah!
We will not let you go!
(Let him go!)
Bismillah!
We will not let you go!

Never, never, never let me go!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
 Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia!
Mamma mia, let me go!
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me!
For me!
For me!
 So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby!
Can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here!
 Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far (got so far)
 Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me (in the end)
 You kept everything inside

 Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream

Yellow desert stream
 My Shangri-La beneath the summer Moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour
And assessing points to nowhere, leading every single one
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the Sun
And take away the plain in which we move
And choose the course you're running
 Down at the edge, round by the corner
Not right away, not right away
Close to the edge, down by a river
Not right away, not right away
 Crossed the line around the changes of the summer
Reaching out to call the color of the sky
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see
Getting over all the time I had to worry
Leaving all the changes far from far behind
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name

 Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see
As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be
 Down at the edge, close by a river
Close to the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by the corner
Down at the edge, round by the river
 Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory
All in all, the journey takes you all the way
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain
 Down at the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by a river
Seasons will pass you by

Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain
 I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
 Two million people barely satisfy
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late
The eyes of honesty can achieve
How many millions do we deceive each day?
 I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
 In charge of who is there in charge of me
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
 I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above
Ah, ah
 Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley
Called to witness cycles only of the past
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark
 Close to the edge, down by the river
Down at the end, round by the corner

Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
 Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
 And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun
 And you run and you run to catch up with the Sun
But it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The Sun is the same, in a relative way
But you're older
Shorter of breath
And one day closer to death
 Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines (oh, oh)
 Hanging on in quiet desperation
Is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say
 Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home, cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
 Far away, across the field

I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
 He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice
 I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
Son, he said, grab your things, I've come to take you home
 To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
 So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut
 I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
Hey, he said, grab your things, I've come to take you home
Ah, back home
 When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
 Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
 Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom

Was shining like a national guitar
I am following the river, down the highway
Through the cradle of the Civil War
 I'm going to Graceland, Graceland
In Memphis, Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poorboys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
 My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But I've reason to believe
We both will be received
In Graceland
 She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead
 And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow
 I'm going to Graceland

Poorboys and Pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
 And my traveling companions
Are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But I've reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland
 There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
Whoa, so this is what she means
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
 And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody feels the wind blow
 In Graceland, in Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend
Every love, every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've a reason to believe
We all will be received

Taken years ago
Turned around, backwards, so the windshield shows
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Still, it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the waters edge
The Moon is low tonight

The recklessness in water
They cannot see me naked

Replaced by every day

Side by side, in orbit

The bright tide that ever drawn
Could not describe

The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny
 I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules
 The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
 The winner takes it all (takes it all)
The loser has to fall (has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (yes, it's plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain?)
 But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed
 The judges will decide (will decide)
The likes of me abide (me abide)
Spectators of the show (of the show)
Always staying low (staying low)
 The game is on again (on again)
A lover or a friend (or a friend)
A big thing or a small (big or small)
The winner takes it all (takes it all)
 I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
 The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
 So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Throw a dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall
Yes, it's plain

Oh, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south London town
 You check out guitar, George
He knows all the chords
Mind he's strictly rhythm
He doesn't wanna make it cry or sing
 Yes, and an old guitar
Is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights
To play his thing
 And Harry doesn't mind
If he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job
He's doin' alright
 He can play the honky-tonk like anything
Savin' it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing
 And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
 They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
And the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans
They play creole, creole
 And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says: At last!
Just as the time bell rings
 Goodnight, now it's time to go home
And he makes it fast with one more thing
We are the Sultans
We are the Sultans of Swing",0.0,0.585820895522388,1.2100000000000009,4.4151740074157715,0.013612880371510983,268,1.0,1

I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
 Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
 You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
 Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living
 See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
 When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said: Somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
 You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way
 So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
 You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
 I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
 So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
 You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
 I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together, you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere

Yo... you ever wake up feeling unusual?
I mean, it's funny what a bad mood'll do
I know some might say I'm not suitable
or maybe I lost my mind, I'm delusional
I mean, when I speak they act like they don't hear me..
When I'm in the streets, they don't wanna come near me
I'm just a little different. Just a little weirdy
When I'm in the hood, be just a little weary
or maybe that's just how I was raised
Trynna find me from ceaser to the grave
Dropped outta school to be around apes
You know I'd do whatever to be around papes
Started gettin more green for kicks
More jeans, more vicodins, some weed, a little morphine
Just need to put my soul in the cleaners
Please lord, forgive me. I'm on my own penis
Am I crazy cuz I really mean this?
Or are y'all stupid and I'm really a genius
We don't think the same
I'm like Josh Howard, I need timeout, but it'd cost the game
Brave nigga, comin to age nigga
Plus in my mind I'm bumpin Gravediggaz
I'm jacked up and I'm tellin my boys
The roof's spinnin around like Jamiroquai
So if you lookin in and you look, the way things look
It don't look like things are lookin up
When I'm in the stew, I'm cookin up
My heart's poundin, got chills, I'm shooken up
I'm out of control... Basically a madman
Trynna make board, I'm workin with a bad hand
I'm stuck and I'm bleeding so
there's really only one thing that I need to know..
 [Cee-Lo] + (Joe Budden)
Does that make me crazy? (Nahmean?)
Does that make me crazy? (I don't really think I'm too crazy.. Ya know!)
Does that make me crazy? (I don't think I'm too different from everybody else...)
Probably... (Nah, maybe I am.)
 [Cee-Lo]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life..
But think twice..
Thats my only advice..

Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence
 In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
 When my eyes were stabbed
By the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
 And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
 People writing songs
That voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence
 Fools, said I, You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
 And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
And the words that it was forming
 And the sign said
The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls

Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
 The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close like brothers?

I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)

And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

To a better day

And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might’ve loved me
And I never knew
 You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same
 So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
 You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
 And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, running back
You're running back for more
 So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time",0.0,0.5025641025641026,0.8700000000000006,9.707175254821777,0.011175047606229782,195,1.1481481481481481,1

Mildewed and smoldering, fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
 The light that fueled our fire
Then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot see to reach an end
Crippling our communication
 I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
 To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication
 The poetry that comes
From the squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance
 There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
 I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication
 Cold silence has
A tendency to
Atrophy any
Sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers

Make it seem like it's been ages
Tomorrow's Sun with buildings scraping skies
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try
 Once I was outside Penn Station
Selling red and white carnations
We were still alone, my wife and I
Before we marry, save my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I want to bring my family state side
 But off the boat they stayed awhile
Then scattered 'cross the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most
I took a walk
 Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
Take a walk, take a walk
I take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
Take a walk, take a walk
 Practice isn't perfect
But the market cuts its loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
There's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
 Once my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she will stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And sit and pray they never feel my strife
 But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments
Now the accounts are overdrawn
I took a walk
 Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
Take a walk, take a walk
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
Take a walk, take a walk
 Honey it's your son
I think I borrowed just to much
We had taxes
We had bills
We had a lifestyle of fun
But I swear tonight I'll come home
And we'll make love like we're young
And tomorrow you'll cook dinner
For the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart the socialists
And all their damn taxes
You'll see I am no criminal I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need
I took a walk
 Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
Take a walk, take a walk
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
Take a walk, take a walk
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
Take a walk, take a walk

Happiness, I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal

Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could

Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
 And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
 Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
 And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before

 Goodbye, Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
 Goodbye, Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
 And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you
But I was just a kid

Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, My God, they've killed them all!
 Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been
The champion of the world
 Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello
Movin' around mysteriously
I didn't do it, he says
And he throws up his hands
I was only robbin' the register
I hope you understand
 I saw them leavin', he says, and he stops
One of us had better call up the cops
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
 Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
 When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before, and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black, you might as well
Not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat
 Alfred Bello had a partner
And he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley
Were just out prowlin' around
He said, I saw two men runnin' out
They looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car
With out of state plates
 And miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said: Wait a minute, boys
This one's not dead
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that
He could identify the guilty men
 Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital
And they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up
Through his one dyin' eye
Says: Why'd you bring him in here for?
He ain't the guy!
 Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been
The champion of the world
 Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America
Fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley is
Still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame
 Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
You think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Think it might'a been that fighter
That you saw runnin' that night?
Don't forget that you are white
 Arthur Dexter Bradley said: I'm really not sure
Cops said: A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
And we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't want to have to go back to jail
Be a nice fellow
 You'll be doin' society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim
 Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
 Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
 All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses
Drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
He was a revolutionary bum
 And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
 Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers
They all went along for the ride
 How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help, but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land
Where justice is a game
 Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the Sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
 That's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been

I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
 Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
 And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue
 She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
 We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
 She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
We'll meet again someday on the avenue
Tangled up in blue
 I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
 So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
 But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I've seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue
 She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
 And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, in the back of my chair
Said to me: Tell me, don't I know your name?
 I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
 She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
I thought you'd never say hello, she said
You look like the silent type
 Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
 And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue
 I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafés at night
And revolution in the air
 Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
 And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
 So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
 Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
 But me, I'm still on the road
A-heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view

It's the same old ending-time to go
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
 Nightime's flyers feel their pains
Drugstore takes down the chains
Metal motion comes in bursts
But the gas station can quench that thirst
Suspension cracked on unmade road
The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'
And out on the subway
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Exits into daylight, spraygun hid
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
 The lamb seems right out of place
Yet the Broadway street sceng finds a focus in its face
Somehow it's lying there
Brings a stillness to the air
Though man-made light, at night is very bright
There's no whitewash victim
As the neons dim, to the coat of white
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Wipes his gun - he's forgotten what he did
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
 Suzanne tired her work all done
Thinks money, honey, be on neon
Cabman's velvet glove sounds the horn
And the sawdust king spits out his scorn
Wonder women draw your blind!
Don't look at me! I'm not your kind
I'm Rael!
Something inside me has just begun
Lord knows what I have done
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
On Broadway
They say the lights are always bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air",0.0,0.6428571428571429,1.1600000000000008,4.623201847076416,0.020806916058063507,266,1.1282051282051282,1

Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten
 Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the DA
Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't try: No Doz
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows
 Get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army if you fail
Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
But losers, cheaters
Six-time users
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Is lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders
Watch your parkin' meters
 Ah get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift

They keep it all hid

Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals

Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, My God, they've killed them all!
 Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been
The champion of the world
 Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello
Movin' around mysteriously
I didn't do it, he says
And he throws up his hands
I was only robbin' the register
I hope you understand
 I saw them leavin', he says, and he stops
One of us had better call up the cops
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
 Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
 When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before, and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black, you might as well
Not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat
 Alfred Bello had a partner
And he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley
Were just out prowlin' around
He said, I saw two men runnin' out
They looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car
With out of state plates
 And miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said: Wait a minute, boys
This one's not dead
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that
He could identify the guilty men
 Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital
And they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up
Through his one dyin' eye
Says: Why'd you bring him in here for?
He ain't the guy!
 Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been
The champion of the world
 Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America
Fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley is
Still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame
 Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
You think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Think it might'a been that fighter
That you saw runnin' that night?
Don't forget that you are white
 Arthur Dexter Bradley said: I'm really not sure
Cops said: A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
And we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't want to have to go back to jail
Be a nice fellow
 You'll be doin' society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim
 Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
 Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
 All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses
Drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
He was a revolutionary bum
 And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
 Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers
They all went along for the ride
 How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help, but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land
Where justice is a game
 Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the Sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
 That's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been

 Things are going to slide
 There'll be the breaking of the ancient
Western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms
There'll be fires on the road
And the white man dancing
You'll see a woman
Hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets
Coming round
Tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
And the white man dancin'
 Give me back the Berlin Wall
Give me Stalin and St Paul
Give me Christ
Or give me Hiroshima
Destroy another fetus now
We don't like children anyhow
I've seen the future, baby
It is murder
 Things are going to slide

 Who would ever thought a guy
Would want a girl like me
Who would ever thought that i would fall so easily
Who would ever thought that we will finally come to
be i guess they just don't know,how much you mean
to me.
Who would ever tought that they would have some
words to say well go on anyway it's allright it's okey
Take what ever comes our way together we will stay
I got three words to say
Never say never
 *verse 1*
 I can't belive they stopped our happiness
By tryin' to pull us down with such a mess
Why can't they let us live just like the rest
And keep us out from all these crazy madness
Now when they talk i think it's just a shame
That all they do is sit and think my name
When all that i do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me
 Maby they can't belive that you and me are together
That's why they should have never
Never say never
There were times when we thought that you and me
could never be together
Thats why we should have never
Never say never say never
 *chorus*
 Now there's a lot of talkin' goin' 'round
About the way you and me gettin' down
What are they jealous are they hatin' me
I guess they all have their own PhD's
I wish that they just stop sweatin' me
Stop try-na get the best of me
No matter what they say baby
Gotta move on cuz' we're gonna be happy
 We didn't let the thoughts that we had
We didn't let the words that they said
Keep us from the love we now have
Never say never
Simply for me to see when
Never would been never fallin'
Now that we are together
Never say never

But when your music proclaims, there's no one can top you

 But is that what you want, to be rich and be gone?
Could be there's just one thing left in the end
Your guitar and your pen
 When you sing to your mum, and you hum and you croon
And she says that she'd like it ""with more of a tune""

I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
 You were always the mysterious one
With dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather
 Well in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees
 These foolish games are tearing me apart
Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart
 You were always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
 You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
So I hid my soiled hands behind my back

Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere
 A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
 Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights, people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night
 Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
 Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
 Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights, people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'm in love with your body
Everyday discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
 One week in, we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
 We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver: Make the radio play
And I'm singing like
 Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say: Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
 I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Everyday discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
 Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I

I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company

Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
 But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
 No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
 Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
 But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

 No clouds in my storms
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame (Eh eh)
Comin' down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone
We Rockafella (Eh eh)
We fly higher than weather
And G5's are better
You know me
An anticipation for precipitation
Stacks chips for the rainy day(Eh eh)
Jay, rain man is back
With lil Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where are you at?
 (Rihanna)
You had my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
 Because...
 When the sun shines
We'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath Imma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella

An Image to my memory

A vision on a magazine
That's when I'll be there
It's something we both share
 Because...
 When the sun shine
We'll shine together
You know I'll be here forever
Although it's a lot of rain outside
Girl it's gettin late and you can stay the night
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car I ain't tryna stress ya

Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
 Baby I'm, dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to, our favorite song
When you said you, looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling you, look perfect tonight
 I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a lover to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
 We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
 Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

She goes unnoticed
She knows no limits
She craves attention
She praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
 Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So, she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made, but
 There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful

And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
 She has dreams to be an envy
So she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says: Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything
What's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer
She fades away
 She don't see her perfect
She don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

Blood stains, ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room

'Cause we never went 'cross the state line
Had to go outside just to talk to each other back then
 'Cause we didn't have facetime

It was hard tryna walk in a straight line

Ah
Savage love
(It's 685, baby)
 If I woke up without, ya
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever, till' I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', be fallin' first
You gotta way of keeping me comin' back to back
 I just found out the only reason that you lovin' me
Is to get back at your ex lover, but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin', I feel it in the air
 Every night and every day (every day)
I try to make you stay
But your
 Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
But when you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
 Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cos I still want that (your savage)
 Baby, I hope this ain't karma 'cos I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', be fallin' first
You gotta way of making me spend up all my cash
 Every night and every day (every day)
I try to make you stay
But your
 Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love

Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say: Goals — bitch, I'm who they tryna be
 Look, I might just chill in some BAPE, I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe, my pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, okay
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill
 Said, lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to

Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold, tell that lil bitch play her role
I just a-rove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott
 Said, lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose

He say he wanna touch it, and tease it, and squeeze it
While my piggy bank is hungry, my nigga, you need to feed it
If the text ain't freaky, I don't wanna read it
And just so let you know, this punani is undefeated, ay
He say he really want to see me more
I said: We should have a date, where? At the Lamborghini store
I’m kinda scary, hard to read, I'm like a Ouija board
But I'ma boss bitch, who you gonna leave me for?
You hoes got no class, you bitches is broke still
I'll be talkin' cash while I'm poppin' my gold grill (uh)
I'ma hoe, rich bitch and I work like I’m broke still (Cardi)
But they love me so fake, but they hate me so real (uh)

Dancing on my ooh, make your girl wanna run

I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know, they don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
 'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
 Pushing me away, so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you, just don't know
Try to run from that, say you're done with that
On your face girl, it just don't show
 When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the parties over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and just go slow
 You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
If you seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
 'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do

Can't deny that I want to, but I lie if have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friend when they ask you
 Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time

You hate being alone when you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream

I let ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that’s standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me
(Gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (amen, lord)
Had a moment but it came and went (they don't love you no more)
You don’t wanna play with him (no, no)
They’ll be mournin' you like 8am (R.I.P.)
Pinky ring till I get a wedding ring (woah, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (big slice)
And you know it's king slime drizzy, damn (woah, yeah)

 Bills so big, I call 'em williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can’t go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents
(I don't do that shit)

Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit

I was born to run, I was born for this
 Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
 I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
 Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
 Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
 Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
 Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this
 Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
 I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
 Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
 Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
 Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me
 I do what it takes
 Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
 Whatever it takes
You take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops

When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like we're on the interstate

Yeah, yeah
 When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
 She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the Sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
 We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
 Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love
 He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the Sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing
 We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it

But they don’t wear these shits where I’m from
I’m not hating, I’m just telling you
I’m tryna let you know what the fuck that I’ve been through
 Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don’t know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from
 No money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
 I’ve been up all night, tryna get that rich
I’ve been work, work, work, work, working on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I’ve been work, work, work, work, working on my shit
Now get this work
 You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I’m trusting
Thorough bread in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that pac shit
My passion was ironic
And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Ran through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At 4 in the morning and now I’m passing the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate be inconsiderate, but the industry took my innocence
Too late, now I’m in this, bitch
You don’t know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels
 No money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
 I’ve been up all night, tryna get that rich
I’ve been work work work work working on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I’ve been work work work work working on my shit

 Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain’t been easy
But cheers to Peezy, for the weeks we lived out of duffle
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my mum, I love you
One day I’ll pay you back for the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
Sixteen you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world and now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

If I ever did that
I think I'd have a heart attack
 Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball
 But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you make me so nervous
That I just can't hold your hand
 You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show

It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts
 But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume
Boy, you, make me so nervous

Can't make you happier now
 Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
 Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
 You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
 Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
 You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
 I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye
 Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
 Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
 I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly unsad

 I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happening?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clapping
 So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
 I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi
 You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
 Jump in the Cadillac
Girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want
Just to put a smile on it
 You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
 Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like
That's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like
That's what I like
 Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like

 I'm talking trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word, and we go
You can be my freaka
Girl, I'll be your fleeko, mamacita
 I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave
 Shopping sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest
 Is it you? (Is it you?)
Is it me? (Is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us)
And I'll agree, baby
