Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
 Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me
To me
 Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
 Mama! Ooh!
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters
 Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind
And face the truth
 Mama! Ooh!
(Anyway the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
 I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche! Scaramouche!
Will you do the fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me!
Galileo! Galileo!
Galileo! Galileo!
Galileo, Figaro!
Magnifico!
 I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
(He's just a poor boy from a poor family)
(Spare him his life, from this monstrosity)
 Easy come, easy go
Will you let me go?
 Bismillah!
No, we will not let you go!
(Let him go!)
Bismillah!
We will not let you go!
(Let him go!)

No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
 Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia!
Mamma mia, let me go!
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me!
For me!
For me!
 So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby!
Can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here!

Remembering all the times you fought with me

 Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me (in the end)

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour
And assessing points to nowhere, leading every single one
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the Sun
And take away the plain in which we move
And choose the course you're running
 Down at the edge, round by the corner
Not right away, not right away
Close to the edge, down by a river
Not right away, not right away
 Crossed the line around the changes of the summer
Reaching out to call the color of the sky
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see
Getting over all the time I had to worry
Leaving all the changes far from far behind
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name

 Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see
As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be
 Down at the edge, close by a river
Close to the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by the corner
Down at the edge, round by the river
 Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory
All in all, the journey takes you all the way
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain
 Down at the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by a river
Seasons will pass you by

Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain
 I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
 Two million people barely satisfy
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late
The eyes of honesty can achieve
How many millions do we deceive each day?
 I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
 In charge of who is there in charge of me
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
 I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, it seems
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above
Ah, ah
 Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley
Called to witness cycles only of the past
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark
 Close to the edge, down by the river
Down at the end, round by the corner

Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
 Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
 And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun
 And you run and you run to catch up with the Sun
But it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The Sun is the same, in a relative way
But you're older
Shorter of breath
And one day closer to death
 Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines (oh, oh)
 Hanging on in quiet desperation
Is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say
 Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home, cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
 Far away, across the field

I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
 He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice
 I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
Son, he said, grab your things, I've come to take you home
 To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
 So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut
 I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
Hey, he said, grab your things, I've come to take you home
Ah, back home
 When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
 Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
 Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom

I am following the river, down the highway
Through the cradle of the Civil War
 I'm going to Graceland, Graceland
In Memphis, Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland

And we are going to Graceland
 My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But I've reason to believe
We both will be received
In Graceland
 She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead
 And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow

And we are going to Graceland

Are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But I've reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland
 There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
Whoa, so this is what she means
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
 And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody feels the wind blow
 In Graceland, in Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend
Every love, every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've a reason to believe
We all will be received

Turned around, backwards, so the windshield shows
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Still, it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the waters edge
The Moon is low tonight

The recklessness in water

Side by side, in orbit

Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules
 The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
 The winner takes it all (takes it all)
The loser has to fall (has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (yes, it's plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain?)
 But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed
 The judges will decide (will decide)
The likes of me abide (me abide)
Spectators of the show (of the show)
Always staying low (staying low)
 The game is on again (on again)
A lover or a friend (or a friend)
A big thing or a small (big or small)
The winner takes it all (takes it all)
 I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
 The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all
 So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Throw a dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall
Yes, it's plain

With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing
 And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
 They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
And the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans
They play creole, creole
 And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says: At last!
Just as the time bell rings
 Goodnight, now it's time to go home
And he makes it fast with one more thing

I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
 Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
 You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
 Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living
 See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
 When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said: Somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
 You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way
 So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
 You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
 I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
 So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone, be someone
 You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
 I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together, you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere

Yo... you ever wake up feeling unusual?
I mean, it's funny what a bad mood'll do
I know some might say I'm not suitable
or maybe I lost my mind, I'm delusional
I mean, when I speak they act like they don't hear me..
When I'm in the streets, they don't wanna come near me
I'm just a little different. Just a little weirdy
When I'm in the hood, be just a little weary
or maybe that's just how I was raised
Trynna find me from ceaser to the grave
Dropped outta school to be around apes
You know I'd do whatever to be around papes
Started gettin more green for kicks
More jeans, more vicodins, some weed, a little morphine
Just need to put my soul in the cleaners
Please lord, forgive me. I'm on my own penis
Am I crazy cuz I really mean this?
Or are y'all stupid and I'm really a genius
We don't think the same
I'm like Josh Howard, I need timeout, but it'd cost the game
Brave nigga, comin to age nigga
Plus in my mind I'm bumpin Gravediggaz
I'm jacked up and I'm tellin my boys
The roof's spinnin around like Jamiroquai
So if you lookin in and you look, the way things look
It don't look like things are lookin up
When I'm in the stew, I'm cookin up
My heart's poundin, got chills, I'm shooken up
I'm out of control... Basically a madman
Trynna make board, I'm workin with a bad hand
I'm stuck and I'm bleeding so
there's really only one thing that I need to know..
 [Cee-Lo] + (Joe Budden)
Does that make me crazy? (Nahmean?)
Does that make me crazy? (I don't really think I'm too crazy.. Ya know!)
Does that make me crazy? (I don't think I'm too different from everybody else...)
Probably... (Nah, maybe I am.)

But think twice..
Thats my only advice..

Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence
 In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
 When my eyes were stabbed
By the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
 And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
 People writing songs
That voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence
 Fools, said I, You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
 And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
And the words that it was forming
 And the sign said
The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls

Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
 The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close like brothers?

To a better day

And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might’ve loved me
And I never knew
 You know I've always been a dreamer
(Spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same
 So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
 You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
 And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, running back
You're running back for more
 So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time",0.0,0.5025641025641026,1.8300000000000014,1.4638046026229858,0.320119279909067,195,1.1481481481481481,1

Mildewed and smoldering, fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
 The light that fueled our fire
Then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot see to reach an end
Crippling our communication

'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
 To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication
 The poetry that comes
From the squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance
 There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
 I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication
 Cold silence has
A tendency to
Atrophy any
Sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers

Make it seem like it's been ages
Tomorrow's Sun with buildings scraping skies
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try
 Once I was outside Penn Station
Selling red and white carnations
We were still alone, my wife and I
Before we marry, save my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I want to bring my family state side
 But off the boat they stayed awhile
Then scattered 'cross the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most
I took a walk
 Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
Take a walk, take a walk
I take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
Take a walk, take a walk
 Practice isn't perfect
But the market cuts its loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
There's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
 Once my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she will stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And sit and pray they never feel my strife
 But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments
Now the accounts are overdrawn
I took a walk
 Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
Take a walk, take a walk
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)
Take a walk, take a walk
 Honey it's your son
I think I borrowed just to much
We had taxes
We had bills
We had a lifestyle of fun
But I swear tonight I'll come home
And we'll make love like we're young
And tomorrow you'll cook dinner
For the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart the socialists
And all their damn taxes
You'll see I am no criminal I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need
I took a walk
 Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk (oh-oh-oh)

Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk

Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
 And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
 Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
 And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
 Goodbye, Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
 Goodbye, Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
 And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you
But I was just a kid

Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, My God, they've killed them all!
 Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been
The champion of the world
 Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello
Movin' around mysteriously
I didn't do it, he says
And he throws up his hands
I was only robbin' the register
I hope you understand
 I saw them leavin', he says, and he stops
One of us had better call up the cops
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
 Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
 When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before, and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black, you might as well
Not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat
 Alfred Bello had a partner
And he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley
Were just out prowlin' around
He said, I saw two men runnin' out
They looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car
With out of state plates
 And miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said: Wait a minute, boys
This one's not dead
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that
He could identify the guilty men
 Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital
And they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up
Through his one dyin' eye
Says: Why'd you bring him in here for?
He ain't the guy!
 Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been
The champion of the world
 Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America
Fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley is
Still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame
 Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
You think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Think it might'a been that fighter
That you saw runnin' that night?
Don't forget that you are white
 Arthur Dexter Bradley said: I'm really not sure
Cops said: A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
And we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't want to have to go back to jail
Be a nice fellow
 You'll be doin' society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim
 Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
 Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
 All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses
Drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
He was a revolutionary bum
 And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
 Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers
They all went along for the ride
 How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help, but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land
Where justice is a game
 Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the Sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
 That's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been

I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
 Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
 And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue
 She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
 We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
 She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
We'll meet again someday on the avenue
Tangled up in blue
 I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
 So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
 But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I've seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue
 She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
 And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, in the back of my chair
Said to me: Tell me, don't I know your name?
 I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
 She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
I thought you'd never say hello, she said
You look like the silent type
 Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
 And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue
 I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafés at night
And revolution in the air
 Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
 And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
 So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
 Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
 But me, I'm still on the road
A-heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view

Ocean winds blow on the land
The Movie-Palace is now undone

It seems they cannot leave their dream
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
 Nightime's flyers feel their pains
Drugstore takes down the chains
Metal motion comes in bursts
But the gas station can quench that thirst
Suspension cracked on unmade road
The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'
And out on the subway

Exits into daylight, spraygun hid
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
 The lamb seems right out of place
Yet the Broadway street sceng finds a focus in its face
Somehow it's lying there
Brings a stillness to the air
Though man-made light, at night is very bright
There's no whitewash victim
As the neons dim, to the coat of white
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Wipes his gun - he's forgotten what he did
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
 Suzanne tired her work all done
Thinks money, honey, be on neon
Cabman's velvet glove sounds the horn
And the sawdust king spits out his scorn
Wonder women draw your blind!
Don't look at me! I'm not your kind
I'm Rael!
Something inside me has just begun
Lord knows what I have done
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
On Broadway
They say the lights are always bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air",0.0,0.6428571428571429,2.6999999999999926,0.6804331541061401,0.3201635869942198,266,1.1282051282051282,1

I guess that changed my mind
 And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time

Disregarding bombs and satellites

You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap

 And the public don't dwell on my transmission
Cause it wasn't televised

Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off

It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten
 Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the DA
Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't try: No Doz
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows
 Get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army if you fail
Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
But losers, cheaters
Six-time users
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Is lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders

Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed

And they put you on the day shift

Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, My God, they've killed them all!
 Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been
The champion of the world
 Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello
Movin' around mysteriously
I didn't do it, he says
And he throws up his hands
I was only robbin' the register
I hope you understand
 I saw them leavin', he says, and he stops
One of us had better call up the cops
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
 Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
 When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before, and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black, you might as well
Not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat
 Alfred Bello had a partner
And he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley
Were just out prowlin' around
He said, I saw two men runnin' out
They looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car
With out of state plates
 And miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said: Wait a minute, boys
This one's not dead
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that
He could identify the guilty men
 Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital
And they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up
Through his one dyin' eye
Says: Why'd you bring him in here for?
He ain't the guy!
 Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been
The champion of the world
 Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America
Fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley is
Still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame
 Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
You think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Think it might'a been that fighter
That you saw runnin' that night?
Don't forget that you are white
 Arthur Dexter Bradley said: I'm really not sure
Cops said: A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
And we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't want to have to go back to jail
Be a nice fellow
 You'll be doin' society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim
 Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
 Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
 All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses
Drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
He was a revolutionary bum
 And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
 Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers
They all went along for the ride
 How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help, but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land
Where justice is a game
 Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the Sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
 That's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell
But one time he could'a been

Turned a whiter shade of pale

One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast

They might have just as well've been closed

Hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets
Coming round
Tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
And the white man dancin'
 Give me back the Berlin Wall
Give me Stalin and St Paul
Give me Christ
Or give me Hiroshima
Destroy another fetus now
We don't like children anyhow
I've seen the future, baby
It is murder
 Things are going to slide

 Who would ever thought a guy
Would want a girl like me
Who would ever thought that i would fall so easily
Who would ever thought that we will finally come to
be i guess they just don't know,how much you mean
to me.
Who would ever tought that they would have some
words to say well go on anyway it's allright it's okey
Take what ever comes our way together we will stay
I got three words to say
Never say never
 *verse 1*
 I can't belive they stopped our happiness
By tryin' to pull us down with such a mess
Why can't they let us live just like the rest
And keep us out from all these crazy madness
Now when they talk i think it's just a shame
That all they do is sit and think my name
When all that i do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me
 Maby they can't belive that you and me are together
That's why they should have never
Never say never
There were times when we thought that you and me
could never be together
Thats why we should have never
Never say never say never
 *chorus*
 Now there's a lot of talkin' goin' 'round
About the way you and me gettin' down
What are they jealous are they hatin' me
I guess they all have their own PhD's
I wish that they just stop sweatin' me
Stop try-na get the best of me
No matter what they say baby
Gotta move on cuz' we're gonna be happy
 We didn't let the thoughts that we had
We didn't let the words that they said
Keep us from the love we now have
Never say never
Simply for me to see when
Never would been never fallin'
Now that we are together
Never say never

But when your music proclaims, there's no one can top you

 But is that what you want, to be rich and be gone?
Could be there's just one thing left in the end
Your guitar and your pen
 When you sing to your mum, and you hum and you croon
And she says that she'd like it ""with more of a tune""

I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
 You were always the mysterious one
With dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather
 Well in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees
 These foolish games are tearing me apart
Your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart
 You were always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
 You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
So I hid my soiled hands behind my back
