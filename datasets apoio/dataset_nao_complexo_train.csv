Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere
 A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
 Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights, people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night
 Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
 Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
 Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights, people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
 You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound?
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready, ‘cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
‘Cause I am a champion
And you're gonna hear me roar
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

 Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
 You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound?

Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
 But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
 No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

But I don't wanna live that way

You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

 The way you are, the way you are

When I see your face there’s not a thing I would change
Cause youre amazing just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile

I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say: I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Getting back together
We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together
 Like, ever!
 I'm really gonna miss you picking fights, and me
Falling for it, screaming that I'm right, and you
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some
Indie record that’s much cooler than mine
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together

Getting back together
 Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, oh, oh, oh
 I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say: Never say never
 Ugh, so he calls me up and he’s like: I still love you
And I'm like, I'm just
Yeah, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together
Like, ever! 
No

I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
 This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care
If nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got
A lot of fight left in me

In the torn up town
No post code envy

Tripping in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room
We don’t care
We’re driving Cadillacs in our dreams
 But everybody’s like Cristal, Maybach
Diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands
Tigers on a gold leash
We don’t care
We aren’t caught up in your love affair
 And we’ll never be royals (royals)

That kind of lux just ain’t for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we’re fine with this
We didn’t come from money

Tripping in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns

Dancing around big eyes as well

Shards beneath our feet

And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
 Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
 These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bending over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, getting nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
 Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
Yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
 You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone

I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces

But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
'Cause she moved on while I'm still grieving
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even, no, oooh

You took your suitcase, I took the blame
Now I'm trying to make sense of what little remains
'Cause you left me with no love, and no love to my name
 I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just praying to a God that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom

No, it don't break, no, it don't break even, no

And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
 There's a guy that lives in the Garden State
And he told me that we'd make it 'till we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate
 I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate
But I always make the same mistakes
Yeah, I always make the same mistakes 'cause
 I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
 Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
 London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about her when I'm riding through
 I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That I'm in too deep
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate

So baby, run away with me
 Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies

But they don’t wear these shits where I’m from
I’m not hating, I’m just telling you
I’m tryna let you know what the fuck that I’ve been through
 Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don’t know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from
 No money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
 I’ve been up all night, tryna get that rich
I’ve been work, work, work, work, working on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I’ve been work, work, work, work, working on my shit
Now get this work
 You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I’m trusting
Thorough bread in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that pac shit
My passion was ironic
And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Ran through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At 4 in the morning and now I’m passing the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate be inconsiderate, but the industry took my innocence
Too late, now I’m in this, bitch
You don’t know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels
 No money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
 I’ve been up all night, tryna get that rich
I’ve been work work work work working on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I’ve been work work work work working on my shit
Now get this work
 Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain’t been easy
But cheers to Peezy, for the weeks we lived out of duffle
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my mum, I love you
One day I’ll pay you back for the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
Sixteen you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn first at the light that’s in front of me
'Cause every night I’mma do it like it’s my last
This dream is all that I need
'Cause its all that I ever had

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world and now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got 'em mirrored

So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
 You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
 Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
 You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
 I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

They couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy
Y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me
It's too late, 'cause I'm here to stay
And these girls know that I'm nasty
I sent her back to her boyfriend
With my handprint on her ass cheek
 City talkin’, we takin’ notes
Tell ‘em all to keep makin’ posts
Wish he could, but he can’t get close
OG so proud of me
That he chokin’ up while he makin’ toast
I'm the type that you can’t control
Said I would, then I made it so
 I don’t clear up rumors (ayy)
Where’s y’all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin’ jokes
‘Cause they got old like baby boomers
Turn my haters to consumers
I make vets feel like they juniors (juniors)
 Say your time is comin’ soon
But just like Oklahoma (mmm)
Mine is comin’ sooner (mmm)
I'm just a late bloomer (mmm)
I didn’t peak in high school
I'm still out here gettin’ cuter (woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin’ ‘round
Like they ain’t losers
